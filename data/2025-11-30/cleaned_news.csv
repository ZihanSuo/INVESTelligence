rare earth,Why EV Manufacturing is Moving Away from Chinese Rare Earths - Manufacturing Digital Magazine,http://manufacturingglobal.com/news/ev-manufacturing-moves-away-from-chinese-rare-earths,"China's export restrictions on rare earth elements are forcing EV manufacturers to innovate and explore alternative technologies to de-risk supply chains

The [electric vehicle (EV)]( industry has a high dependence on rare earth materials, which are largely produced and processed in China.

Trade restrictions imposed by the Chinese government, however, are prompting EV manufacturers to seek technological alternatives and diversify their sourcing strategies.

The move follows the introduction of a new licensing system by China for the export of these elements, adding complexity and uncertainty for manufacturers. This has direct implications for EV production, with research from IDTechEx finding that, in 2024, 87% of the global EV market used motors with rare earth magnets.

Rare earth elements are a group of 17 metallic elements important for the high-powered magnets used in electric vehicle motors. China's dominance in this sector is substantial, overseeing 61% of global rare earth production and 90% of the processing.

The new licensing system for exports creates a more complex procurement process, affecting the global supply chain.

Most EV motors use neodymium magnets, which contain the rare earths dysprosium and terbium, both of which are covered by the export restrictions. Each of these motors can contain 1-3kg of these magnets.

In 2023, this reliance caused production delays and reductions for major automotive companies, including Ford and Suzuki Motor, highlighting the disruption that can stem from a dependency on a single supplier nation.

“We all got a wake-up call this year,” comments Barbara Humpton, CEO of USA Rare Earth. “There has been globalisation, which has driven so much manufacturing overseas. And when China decided that they would not be providing rare earth for the magnets to the US and our trading partners, that sent a shockwave through the system.”

While other regions are making investments in the mining and production of rare earths, establishing these operations requires considerable time and capital. In response, the motor industry is focusing on reducing the amount of rare earths in their products.

The reduction and elimination of rare earths are now a focus for electric [motor manufacturers]( and EV OEMs. One approach is to improve the power density and efficiency of motors, which can lower the reliance on these materials.

Developing higher-speed motors could also reduce overall material consumption, as these motors can be smaller while delivering the same power output.

Companies such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda have already made progress in reducing their dependence on rare earths through advances in material engineering, including the tight control of impurities and the refining of grain structure.

Furthermore, the development of more effective thermal management systems could reduce the need for heavy rare earths, which are primarily used to prevent demagnetisation at high temperatures.

The externally excited synchronous motor (EESM) presents a commercially viable alternative that is already in use by Renault, BMW and Nissan in some of their EV models. This motor design uses copper electromagnets on the rotor instead of rare-earth permanent magnets.

While the design is more complex because the rotor windings require a power source and its efficiency is lower than a permanent magnet motor, it is a cost-effective and practical option when access to rare earths is constrained.

Ferrite magnets are another substitute for [rare earths]( Although they are not as magnetic, meaning a larger volume is needed to achieve similar performance, they are abundant and widely available.

The increased size requirement presents design challenges for manufacturers, as the motor must be made considerably larger. Despite this, it remains a suitable option for certain vehicle segments.

Concurrently, companies are researching other magnetic materials. The goal is to identify a material with low cost and high availability that can be applied across various applications.

Through this exploration, concerns within the EV supply chain could be diminished, allowing manufacturers to diversify their material sourcing and limit their exposure to geopolitical trade shifts.

## Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPMs) are one of the strongest types of permanent magnets and are vital for electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defence applications.

The Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi approved the 'Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnets' with a financial outlay of Rs.7280 crore. This first-of-its-kind initiative aims to establish 6,000 Metric Tons per Annum (MTPA) of integrated Rare Earth Permanent Magnet (REPM) manufacturing in India, thereby enhancing self-reliance and positioning India as a key player in the global REPM market.

REPMs are one of the strongest types of permanent magnets and are vital for electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defence applications. The Scheme will support the creation of integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, involving conversion of rare earth oxides to metals, metals to alloys, and alloys to finished REPMs.

Driven by the rapidly growing demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, industrial applications, and consumer electronics, India's consumption of REPMs is expected to double by 2030 from 2025. At present, India's demand for REPMs is met primarily through imports. With this initiative, India will establish its first ever integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, generating employment, strengthening self-reliance and advancing the nation's commitment to achieve Net Zero by 2070.

The total financial outlay of the scheme is Rs.7280 crore, comprising a sales-linked incentives of Rs. 6450 crore on REPM sales for five (5) years and capital subsidy of Rs.750 crore for setting up an aggregate of 6,000 MTPA of REPM manufacturing facilities.

The scheme envisions allocating the total capacity to five beneficiaries through a global competitive bidding process. Each beneficiary will be allotted up to 1,200 MTPA of capacity.

The total duration of the scheme will be 7 years from the date of award, including a 2-year gestation period for setting up an integrated REPM manufacturing facility, and 5 years for incentive disbursement on the sale of REPM.

This initiative by the Government of India is a landmark step towards strengthening the domestic REPM manufacturing ecosystem and enhancing competitiveness in the global markets. By fostering indigenous capabilities in REPM production, the scheme will not only secure the REPM supply chain for domestic industries but also support the nation’s Net Zero 2070 commitment. It embodies the Governments unwavering commitment to build a technologically self-reliant, globally competitive, and sustainable industrial base, in line with the vision of Viksit Bharat @2047.

rare earth,‘Time to act now’: The push to develop Europe’s blockbuster rare earths discoveries - CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/28/rare-earths-the-push-to-develop-europes-critical-mineral-discoveries.html,"* From an ‘invisible mine’ to a radical relocation, two mining companies at the heart of Europe's resource security push are taking very different approaches.

* ""It is really the time to act now. We have always said that we are too early until we are too late,"" Alf Reistad, CEO of mining firm Rare Earths Norway, told CNBC.

* By the end of the decade, the European Union wants to extract 10%, process 40% and recycle 25% of what it consumes each year.

In this aerial view, the Kiruna Kyrka church is transported by road to a new location on August 20, 2025 in Kiruna, Sweden. The church, weighing 672,4 tons, is being transported as a whole to a new location 3 km away to avoid damages caused by LKAB´s iron ore mine.

Two Nordic mining companies at the heart of Europe's push to achieve [resource security]( are taking novel — albeit very different — approaches. One is pursuing the concept of an ""invisible mine,"" while the other is taking on one of the world's most radical relocation projects.

It forms part of a strategic shift for the European Union. Under its forthcoming ""[RESourceEU]( initiative, the 27-nation bloc intends to step up its efforts to secure access to domestic sources of critical raw materials in both the short- and long-term.

The plan, which intends to boost investment in strategic projects, is designed to help break China's [long-held mineral dominance](

Alf Reistad, CEO of mining firm Rare Earths Norway, told CNBC that there's been a clear shift in terms of how both domestic and EU policymakers are thinking about mineral supply chains.

""What we see now is really a sense of urgency. Everybody is speaking about the need for actions,"" Reistad told CNBC by video call. ""It is really the time to act now. We have always said that we are too early until we are too late.""

In June last year, Rare Earths Norway [announced]( the discovery of Europe's largest known rare earths deposit, reflecting what was seen as a watershed moment in the region's pursuit of strategic autonomy.

It's [estimated]( that the firm's Fen Carbonatite Complex, situated in the small industrial town of Ulefoss in southern Norway, contains 8.8 million metric tons of total rare earth oxides (TREOs).

> It's not a given that this is a business case. It looks like it is for us at the moment, but it's not something that you'd say, 'oh it's a no brainer, just run for it.'

Notably, roughly 1.5 million tons of these TREOs are thought to contain highly prized magnet-related rare earths, such as neodymium and praseodymium. These are critical components for a range of modern technologies, from electric vehicles and wind turbines to robotics and defense applications.

Rare Earths Norway said it is currently in close cooperation with the local municipality and national authorities over a zoning plan and hopes to present a prefeasibility study by the end of the year.

Ultimately, however, it faces a long road ahead to deliver on its rare earths potential. The company is targeting the delivery of rare earths to market by the first half of the 2030s.

## The Enhanced Games?

To help reach these targets, Rare Earths Norway has been lobbying for domestic and EU policymakers to consider fast-track permitting and price guarantees, saying such measures will be pivotal to its success.

Reistad compared the firm's push to deliver on its resource potential to participating in the [Enhanced Games]( a controversial event that allows athletes to take banned performance enhancing drugs under medical supervision.

""If you look now at what you see with China and the U.S., they are competing in a kind of Enhanced Games, and it's not possible for us to compete at all if we have no security,"" Reistad said.

""You see that the [actions that have been made by [U.S. President Donald] Trump]( He has been fast and bold. So, if there is no level playing field then it will not be possible to come true with this project,"" he added.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen delivers her speech during a debate on the new 2028-2034 Multi-annual Financial Framework at the European Parliament in Brussels on November 12, 2025.

A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, told CNBC that the bloc has a ""clear vision"" to ensure the secure and sustainable access to raw materials. By 2030, the bloc wants to extract 10%, process 40% and recycle 25% of what it consumes each year.

The EU is also aiming to limit reliance on any single external supplier to 65%.

To develop its discovery, Rare Earths Norway is planning to extract rare earths from its Fen site using an ""invisible mine"" concept to avoid surface disruption and environmental impact.

This concept involves drilling a long, narrow tunnel diagonally beneath the village of Ulefoss and backfilling extracted voids with waste materials.

""It's important that people on top of the deposit are safe,"" Reistad said, who compared the concept to that of a ""Kinder Egg.""

[A lesson for the West? Japan was better prepared than most for China’s rare-earth mineral squeeze](

""So, if you have seen in the project by LKAB in Kiruna, they have to [move the town]( We need to prevent that, and its approximately 300 properties on top of the deposit and a lot of people living there,"" he added.

Reistad said the company has had ""very good"" dialogue with the people living on top of the rare earths deposit. Early community surveys have [reportedly]( shown strong local support for the project, alongside some concerns about stability and waste management.

Swedish state-owned mining firm LKAB, which operates far above the Arctic Circle in the city of Kiruna, is taking a completely different approach to Europe's growing appetite for raw materials.

The company [announced]( in January 2023 what was then considered to be Europe's largest known deposit of rare earths, describing the discovery as ""good news"" for Sweden, Europe and the climate.

Rain falls as a general view taken on August 21, 2025 shows the LKAB iron ore mine and a sign bearing the company's logo in Kiruna, northern Sweden.

The discovery of the so-called Per Geijer deposit sits in close proximity to the world's largest underground iron ore mine. Indeed, it is LKAB's plans to expand its iron ore mine that has prompted the move of thousands of city residents to a brand-new city center.

The extensive urban relocation project received international attention in August, when workers [successfully moved]( a 113-year-old wooden church five kilometers (3 miles) down the road over the course of two days.

Later that same month, LKAB [announced]( that 6,000 more people and approximately 2,700 homes would be affected by the relocation. The transformation is estimated to come at a cost of 22.5 billion Swedish kronor ($2.4 billion).

Niklas Johansson, senior vice president of public affairs and external relations at LKAB, said the relocation is not related to the rare earths discovery, but rather the firm's sprawling iron ore mine.

A worker is pictured in the underground tunnels of the LKAB iron ore mine in Kiruna, northern Sweden, on August 21, 2025.

Like Rare Earths Norway, LKAB's Johansson said the company is currently in discussion with European lawmakers to ensure that it will be economically viable to develop its resources.

""We've already got the material up to the ground. That's all been paid for by the iron ore. Still, it's not a given that this is a business case. It looks like it is for us at the moment, but it's not something that you'd say, 'oh it's a no brainer, just run for it,'"" Johansson told CNBC by telephone.

""I also tell them that if it looks like this for us, who has most of the infrastructure and everything in place, how do you think it will look for others in Europe?""

Anthony Heron, deputy editor of the Arctic Institute think tank, said the projects overseen by Rare Earths Norway and LKAB are ""strategically significant"" because they represent some of the most credible paths to reduce Europe's near total dependence on imported rare earths, especially from China.

""Estimates suggest the Norwegian Fen deposit could cover a sizeable share of future EU demand for rare earth minerals, and the exploration of Arctic deposits has been framed by analysts as pillars of Europe's emerging 'mineral sovereignty' agenda,"" Heron told CNBC by email.

""That aligns the Arctic squarely with the EU Critical Raw Materials Act, which has set targets for a minimum share of extraction to take place within Europe,"" he added.",0.9

The total duration of the scheme will be seven years from the date of award, including a two year gestation period for setting up an integrated Rare Earth Permanent Magnet manufacturing facility. The scheme envisions allocating the total capacity to five beneficiaries through a global competitive bidding process.

The Union Minister said that Cabinet has also given its nod to Pune Metro Rail Project Phase-2. He said government has approved Line 4 (Kharadi-Hadapsar-Swargate-Khadakwasla) and Line 4A (Nal Stop-Warje-Manik Baug) under Phase-2 of the Pune Metro Rail Project. Mr Vaishnaw said the project will be completed within five years at an estimated cost of around 9 thousand 857 crore rupees.

With this latest approval, Pune Metro’s network will expand beyond the 100 kilometers. This is a significant step in the city’s journey towards a modern, integrated, and sustainable urban transit system.

Mr. Vaishnaw also said that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has given its approval to two projects of Ministry of Railways with a total cost of 2 thousand 781 crore rupees. Devbhumi Dwarka (Okha) – Kanalus rail line has been approved at a cost of one thousand 457 crore rupees while Badlapur – Karjat third and fourth line project was cleared with an estimaed cost of one thousand 324 crore rupees. Mr. Vaishnaw said that the two projects covering four districts across Gujarat and Maharashtra will increase the existing network of Indian Railways by about 224 kilometers.

He said, the  doubling of rail line from Kanalus to Okha would provide enhanced connectivity to Dwarkadhish temple facilitating access to key pilgrimage destination and lead to all round development of Saurashtra region in Gujarat. Mr Vaishnaw said that Badlapur – Karjat section forms part of Mumbai suburban corridor. The third and fourth line project in Maharastra will improve the connectivity in Mumbai suburban area and meet the future demands of passengers, along with providing connectivity to Southern India.
