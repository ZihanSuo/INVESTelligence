China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing anytime soon.\n\nThe alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have [promised a truce over rare earth minerals]( the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.\n\nAlthough a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the [Chinese export restrictions]( introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.\n\nBut other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.\n\nYttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.\n\nThe problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.\n\nWhen Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty about delivery times. In the rare earths trade, lack of predictability is often more damaging than reduced volumes: An industry accustomed to just-in-time deliveries can be thrown into crisis by even a few weeks of delay.\n\nThe effects were immediate. In Europe, yttrium oxide prices have soared, reaching a 4,400 percent increase since the beginning of the year. Aerospace companies, which rely heavily on this material, have expressed alarm and demanded urgent measures from the US government to expand domestic production. The semiconductor industry is no less concerned: Some companies have called the situation a “serious” threat, predicting impacts on costs, efficiency, and production timelines. Gas-fired power plants, which use yttrium in the protective coatings of turbines, are also monitoring Chinese developments with increasing attention, although they maintain that they have not yet experienced disruptions.\n\nThe situation in warehouses outside China adds further layers of complexity. Available reserves, according to piecemeal estimates, range from one to 12 months, depending on the producers. Some traders have already reported running out of material; from quantities in the hundreds of tons range, many are down to just a few units. Others are completely out of stock. This volatility makes the market extremely fragile and underscores how the global supply chain depends on a small number of players.\n\nChinese exports to several countries have fallen by about 30 percent. China, which aims to become an autonomous tech powerhouse, therefore maintains a position of strength and a high degree of discretion, carefully regulating the quantities released to the international market. Moreover, the measures introduced by Beijing in the sector from the outset are flexible enough to allow it to modulate the flow of shipments according to political priorities.\n\nOn the political front, the trade truce between Washington and Beijing has yet to produce concrete results. The two sides have given negotiators until the end of November to outline clearer terms for rare earth exports to the United States, but the gap between their respective priorities remains wide. Beijing continues to work on a licensing system, inspired by mechanisms already used by the United States, that would allow for faster flow only to companies deemed to have no ties to the US military industry. This would leave many Western companies operating in the delicate boundary between civilian production and defense applications at a disadvantage, further complicating access to materials.\n\nChina's strategy involves not only controlling trade flows, but also managing technical expertise internationally. Authorities have begun requiring detailed lists of technicians specializing in rare earths, restricting their travel abroad and monitoring potential transfers of expertise to rival countries. At the same time, bans on the export of advanced rare earth processing technologies continue, a sector in which China holds a leadership position that is unlikely to be replicated in the short term. This dual approach—control of physical resources and human capital—strengthens Chinese primacy and hampers attempts to build an alternative supply chain.\n\nThe United States is nevertheless trying to fight back. New industrial projects, such as that of ReElement Technologies in Indiana, aim to produce yttrium oxide domestically starting in December, with an initial capacity of 200 tons per year, set to double within a few months. While this figure isn't enough to cover total US needs, it represents a first step toward diversification.\n\nDuring Trump's recent visit to Asia, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to jointly exploit the giant Minamitori undersea deposit, discovered years ago in the Pacific seabed. Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of a joint study to develop technologies and infrastructure capable of extracting these strategic materials from extreme ocean depths, a feat that will require enormous investment and advanced technical cooperation.\n\nYet the absence of a complete supply chain—from extraction to refining—makes the transition slow and complex. China has no intention of giving up its dominant position, a crucial and potentially decisive negotiating lever.\n\nTopics[China](/tag/china/)[manufacturing](/tag/manufacturing/)[materials](/tag/materials/)[Metal](/tag/metal/)[trade](/tag/trade/)\n\n*The Fantastic Four: First Steps*, *Thunderbolts\\**, and *Something Wicked This Way Comes* are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nGet 10% off your first order at Western Digital when you register your email.\n\nEnjoy up to 50% off deliveries, free meals, and more with the latest Home Chef coupons.\n\nYou can snag a discount on all the Pixel 10 phone varieties if you act fast.\n\nThis $400 set comes with minifigures of the complete Next Gen crew, including Picard, Riker, and Wesley Crusher’s portable tractor beam.\n\nSave hundreds on our preferred MacBook for most people.\n\nAll-Clad cookware is the best you can buy—and it has a price tag to match.

[Yttrium]( (Y), [terbium]( (Tb), [erbium]( (Er), and [ytterbium]( (Yb) are all named after the village.\n\nOther elements including holmium, gadolinium, scandium, tantalum, and thulium were first discovered there, making Ytterby the richest source of naturally occurring elements on Earth.\n\nBack in 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius discovered a strange, unusually heavy black ore in an old quarry near Ytterby. This new ore was named by Arrhenius as ytterbite.\n\nTwo years later, a Finnish chemist identified from Arrhenius’ initial sample the first rare earth element – named yttrium. In just over 50 years following Arrhenius’ original discovery, Carl Gustav Mosander found that ytterbite was actually a mixture of three metal oxides, and a fourth was later discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac from the original sample.\n\nEventually as refining techniques improved, more new elements were discovered and ultimately over the next 100 years since Arrhenius’ discovery, nine more elements fell out of this strange, unusually heavy black ore.\n\nAmong these hard-to-pronounce elements is yttrium – a soft, grey-white metal that is fairly stable in air but reacts with water, acids, and bases.\n\nIt occurs in other ‘rare earth’ minerals, monazite and bastnaesite, though xenotime, which is mined in China and Malaysia, can contain up to 50% yttrium phosphate, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nYttrium metal is produced by reducing yttrium fluoride with calcium metal and is often used as an additive in alloys for its strengthening properties. When alloyed with aluminum, magnesium, and chromium, it acts to strengthen those metals.\n\nIn addition to its applications in speciality alloys found in engines, yttrium is used in coatings to shield against high temperatures.\n\nYttrium oxide is added to glass used to produce camera lenses as it makes them heat and shock resistant. It’s found in white LED lights as well as superconductors and lasers, with yttrium oxysulfide widely sought to produce red phosphors for old-style colour television tubes.\n\nLasers that can cut through metals require yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG), marking yet another of its many applications in everyday life.\n\nWhile its origins may come from Sweden, like other rare earths and critical minerals, China dominates global production and supply of yttrium. China supplies the US 93% of its yttrium imports, creating acute vulnerability across Western supply chains.\n\nThe world’s supplies are now running low due to Chinese export restrictions, sparking fears of looming protracted shortages, and rocketing costs that could hit every sector from aerospace, to energy and semiconductor production.\n\nOn the back of China restricting yttrium exports (along with six other rare earths in April in retaliation to the US tariffs) yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) prices have been soaring more than 4,000% in Europe in 2025.\n\nRecently, prices surpassed US$275/kg, as China’s tightening export controls disrupt global supply chains for military and defence, aerospace, semiconductors, and advanced materials. These shortages are also affecting markets related to high-temperature alloys, laser systems, avionics, and defence components.\n\nMagnet rare earth prices also remain high, with Benchmark reporting Dy oxide (DDP China) at over US$200/kg and Tb oxide (DDP China) at almost US$1,000/kg.\n\n[Victory Metals]( (ASX:VTM) CEO Brendan Clark says this global backdrop highlights the company’s strategic positioning as a major future yttrium supplier with what’s emerging as a valuable heavy rare earth basket.\n\nThe company’s current mineral resource hosts over 35 million kilograms of Y₂O₃ with forecast production targets over 600 tonnes annually tonnes along with strategic critical minerals dysprosium, terbium, neodymium and praseodymium, gallium, hafnium, and scandium.\n\nClark says yttrium is emerging as one of the world’s most important critical minerals and this global supply crunch is happening much faster than anyone expected.\n\n*“Our North Stanmore deposit continues to demonstrate the scale, grade, and mineralogy required to supply Western nations with secure, long-term yttrium supply,”* the CEO adds.\n\nVictory is now advancing discussions with multiple strategic partners across the defence, aerospace, automotive, and semiconductor sectors seeking secure non-Chinese heavy rare earth supply.\n\nClark says the surge in yttrium pricing materially enhances Victory’s Prefeasibility Study (PFS), with the company continuing to integrate high value heavy rare earths including yttrium, dysprosium, terbium, and recently confirmed gallium into its economic modelling.\n\nThe CEO recently told shareholders at the company’s AGM that China’s moves to ban the export of key defence-related minerals such as terbium, dysprosium and scandium is an opportunity for Victory Metals to demonstrate its capability to produce these critical materials at scale and to help Australia become a key player in the global energy transition.\n\n*“We expect the PFS will define the processing pathway, costs, and production strategy for the North Stanmore project, and demonstrate how the underlying resources can be turned into a commercial, scalable operation,”* Clark says.\n\nClark notes an exhaustive PFS into Victory’s flagship North Stanmore Project, near Cue in Western Australia’s Mid West region, continues to indicate the project’s potential as one of the most advanced heavy rare earth clay-hosted deposits.\n\n> ***“We are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements”***\n\n*“Indications are we can avoid complex cracking or additional capital-intensive processing and environmental impacts, which further strengthens our value as a secure, reliable and capable potential supplier of high-purity feedstock to global processors,”* the CEO adds.\n\n*“With minimal processing under our proposed operating model, we are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements.”*\n\nOver the past 12 months, Clark says Victory has attracted strong international and institutional backing, and significant interest from government and private sector defence manufacturers around the world seeking secure off-take agreements.\n\nIn August 2025, the company raised $11.5 million through a placement of new shares to institutional, professional and sophisticated investors.\n\nIn October, Victory signed a non-binding LoI with Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation to advance offtake and strategic cooperation for North Stanmore, covering up to 30% of annual production, including up to 50 tonnes of Dy-Tb product over an initial five-year term.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank has also offered an LoI regarding funding support of US$190 million.\n\nVictory Metals is among a number of Australian rare earths explorers thrust into the global spotlight, following the landmark agreement between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to facilitate the investment of the billions of dollars needed to establish secure and reliable rare earth and critical minerals supply chains.\n\nWith the state of the market, [ABx Group]( (ASX:ABX) has also been ramping up efforts to become a significant player in rare earths space. It’s been raising $6.05 million through a placement to fund development activities at the Deep Leads Project in Tasmania and construction of the ALCORE pilot plant.\n\nFunds will be deployed to engineering and metallurgical studies, exploration drilling for a resource increase, and to secure offtake agreements for the Deep Leads Project.\n\nProceeds will also cover construction and commissioning costs of the ALCORE pilot plant to produce hydrogen and fluoride from aluminium smelter bath waste.\n\nThe Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ([ANSTO]( has started production of ABx’s first mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) product using 50kg of a 100kg bulk sample, with completion expected before the end of November 2025.\n\nThe sample will be distributed to potential customers and offtake partners for evaluation.\n\nABx is running a program to produce a saleable MREC product from its Deep Leads ionic adsorption clay rare earth project in Tasmania to be used in downstream refining to produce separated rare earth oxides, REE metals, and magnets essential for EV motors, guidance systems, wind turbines, and other clean-energy technologies.\n\nRare earth refineries (solvent-extraction plants) commonly accept MREC because it’s a standardised, transportable feedstock from which high-purity rare earth oxides and metals can be produced.\n\nIn partnership with external engineering experts, ABx conducted a formal processing options analysis. A key conclusion is that column leach tests should be conducted to confirm that the high extractions obtained in diagnostic leach tests in tanks are also observed in a column leach arrangement.\n\nANSTO is conducting initial column leach tests planned to begin in November, with results available by early 2026.\n\nManaging Director of emerging rare earths producer [OD6 Metals]( (ASX:OD6), Brett Hazelden, believes there is plenty of opportunity for Western countries like Australia to capture a substantial share of the burgeoning market dominated by China.\n\nRecently speaking to *Mining.com.au*, Hazelden says US President Donald Trump is changing the way governments work with private industry, which reshaping how government and private partnerships can work in an investor scheme to bolster Western supply chains.\n\nIf the Western world does not want all roads leading to China, Hazelden argues they need to obviously pay a fair price that allows people to make money but also allows them to participate in the next part of the value chain as well.\n\nThe make-up of OD6’s Splinter Rock Rare Earth Elements Project in Western Australia opens up a plethora of potential end-user avenues for the minnow. The emerging rare earths producer has proven it can produce a clean, high-quality mixed rare earth carbonate, which is a product highly sought after by several end users.\n\nOD6 has now identified another avenue for consideration down the track for the production of samarium and yttrium oxides, which are both used in nuclear reactors for clean power generation and nuclear medicine.\n\nSamarium is also used in the manufacture of high-temperature samarium-cobalt magnets for headphones, electric motors and aerospace applications.\n\nIn early October, OD6 elected a preferred [flowsheet]( with the aim of producing MREC and mixed rare earth hydroxide (MREH). Flowsheet testing undertaken by ANSTO achieved a MREC recovery of about 56% total rare earth oxide (TREO), and a MREH recovery of roughly 59% TREO.\n\nThe process demonstrated low levels of aluminium, iron, phosphorus and silicon impurities, and extremely low uranium and thorium content of less than 0.001%. Overall recoveries of the most in-demand magnet rare earths, neodymium and praseodymium, reached around 75% for OD6.\n\nThe high value magnet rare earths account for 23% of the TREO grade at Splinter Rock, which hosts a resource so far of 682 million tonnes @ 1,338 parts per million for 910,000 tonnes of contained TREO. The magnet rare earths provide about 205,000 tonnes of the contained resource.\n\nMining.com.au Editor-in-Chief Adam Orlando has more than 20 years’ experience in the media having held senior roles at various publications, including as Asia-Pacific Sector Head (Mining) at global newswire Acuris (formerly Mergermarket).

Notably, the sides agreed on enhanced pension system cooperation and signed a memorandum to advance veterinary services and agricultural research.\n\nKazakhstan’s National Academy of Sciences and Turkmenistan’s Academy of Sciences also agreed to increase research collaboration.\n\nAccording to [The Times of Central Asia]( Kazakhstan, long recognized for its substantial rare earth metals reserves, is moving beyond the familiar characterization of “underutilized potential” and is taking on a more active role in global critical material supply chains. The state-owned mining company Tau-Ken Samruk has become a key driver of this shift, expanding both at home and abroad.\n\nKazakhstan recently confirmed a new deposit with major reserves of cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and yttrium, strengthening its position as one of the few countries producing more than half of the known rare earth elements. The national strategy now centers on developing a full industrial cycle rather than exporting raw materials.\n\nA clear example of this change came in 2025, when Tau-Ken Samruk signed an agreement with U.S. based Cove Capital to develop the Severny Katpar and Verkhniy Kairakty tungsten deposits. A similar project with China’s Xiamen Tungsten collapsed in 2018 without binding commitments, highlighting growing geopolitical competition around Kazakhstan’s resources.\n\nThe country is also expanding internationally. According to Samruk-Kazyna chairman Nurlan Zhakupov, Kazakhstan aims to process materials from both domestic and foreign sources. “Tau-Ken Samruk is actively engaging with foreign partners,” he said, noting exploration projects underway in Rwanda and Afghanistan.\n\nThese efforts illustrate Kazakhstan’s ambition to secure a larger role in global supply chains. Despite political and security risks abroad, the country continues to pursue long-term partnerships and deeper integration into the rare earth market.\n\nWomen in Kazakhstan are reshaping the tech landscape, entering the sector from diverse backgrounds and driving new forms of innovation, [Euronews]( reports.\n\nA key figure in this movement is Assem Bolatzhan, who shifted from finance to IT in 2015 through the Digital Kazakhstan program.\n\n“We launched the Women in Tech chapter in Kazakhstan because we need to be part of a global community,” she says.\n\nAccording to Women in Tech Astana lead Rinata Ilyubayeva, nearly 60% of women-led startups focus on social impact.\n\n“Most female startups are in EdTech, HealthTech, and solutions for children with autism, elderly people, and pregnant women,” she notes.\n\nThe momentum has led to the creation of Central Asia’s first female-focused venture capital initiative.\n\n“We are building a platform to support women, because it’s not always easy,” says Ilyubayeva.\n\nEntrepreneurs like Aigerim Nurgaliyeva show how women without technical training can succeed.\n\n“The first obstacle was in my mind,” she says. “You can build a startup without coding.”\n\nSCAT Airlines (DV, Shymkent) is considering adding either B777 or B787 aircraft to its fleet for deliveries after 2030, Aviation Week has reported, citing senior marketing manager Zhanar Balgabay.\n\nAccording to [ch-aviation]( data, the Kazakh airline currently has commitments for seven more B737-8s and one additional B737-9.\n\nIts in-house fleet comprises one B737-300, three B737-500s, one B737-700, seven B737-8s, eight B737-800s, five B737-9s, two CRJ200ERs, and two CRJ200LRs.\n\nIn addition, three B757-200s and one B767-300ER are operated by subsidiary Sunday Airlines (Shymkent), which deploys the aircraft on charter services to destinations including Phuket, Dhaka, Moscow Vnukovo, Phu Quoc, and Nha Trang Cam Ranh.\n\nMeanwhile, SCAT Airlines has firmed plans to launch flights from Turkistan to Urgench, Bukhara, and Samarkand by December 2025. The carrier currently serves 40 destinations across 16 countries, operating a total of 61 routes.\n\nKazakhstan wins second straight Asia Championship with win over Japan, Korea beats China to finish second\n\n**IIHF.com: Kazakhstan wins second straight Asia Championship with win over Japan, Korea beats China to finish second**\n\nKazakhstan secured back-to-back titles at the IIHF Ice Hockey Men’s Asia Championship, going undefeated in Beijing with a 3-0 record and a 13-6 goal ratio.

we especially liked that there was almost no discount to the market price AND the board participated in the round (both good signals for a capital raise).*\n\n**LSR** started its [**first exploration program**](/quick-takes/lsr-starts-exploration-on-us-heavy-rare-earths-project/) on its project in Arizona.\n\n*Previous sampling at LSR’s project showed 0.53-1.26% TREO, importantly with ~57% heavy rare earths (the valuable ones).*\n\n*The big win for us will be if LSR can show those same grades are consistent across a bigger part of its project.*\n\n**SS1** [**released another drill result**](/quick-takes/ss1-hits-silver-and-gold-26m-above-its-existing-480m-ounce-silver-equivalent-resource/) from its 2025 drill program.\n\n*The kicker for us was that mineralisation in the assay results started a lot closer to surface compared to where SS1’s resource estimate begins.*\n\n*Near surface results could be a game changer for SS1’s project, removing all of the risks related to pre-stripping a deep orebody (i.e. mining the waste rock above the existing resource).*\n\n**HAR** [**completed its second round of drilling**](/quick-takes/har-completes-drilling-on-gold-project-assay-results-coming-next-month/) on its gold project in Senegal.\n\n*HAR is following up the results from a few months ago including the 20m intercept grading 6.54g/t gold.*\n\n*HAR is moving very quickly here (which always makes us pay a lot more attention) and has already committed to deeper RC/diamond drilling in early 2026.*\n\nThis week **HAR** also [**confirmed a drill rig is on site**](/quick-takes/har-to-start-drilling-on-us-gold-project-today/) at its US based gold project in California **AND that drilling was scheduled to have started on the night shift of Friday 28th November.**\n\nThe goal is to convert the current resource to JORC compliant, and HAR expects to complete this by late January 2026.\n\n**TTM** [**released more drill results**](/quick-takes/ttm-results-set-to-add-to-resource-as-lingbao-prepares-for-another-visit/) from its 3.1Moz gold and 22Moz silver project in Ecuador.\n\n*More interesting to us though was the confirmation, strategic investor Lingbao was “preparing a second site visit” as part of its due diligence toward doing a potential project level transaction with TTM for the Dynasty Gold Project.*\n\n**88E** put out an [**update on its projects in Alaska**](/quick-takes/88e-to-flow-test-well-next-to-711m-neighbour/), USA.\n\n*88E is fully carried for all costs associated with an upcoming horizontal well and extended flow test. 88E’s farm in partner is Burgundy Xploration, who is gearing up for an IPO in the US to support operational spend.*\n\n**MNB** provided an [**update for its Cabinda phosphate project**](/quick-takes/mnb-update-on-angolan-phosphate-project/) in Angola.\n\n*IF the alternative structure can be pulled off, MNB could be fast-tracking first production by simplifying its processing flowsheet, removing crushing, drying, and dust extraction to cut ~$20M in CAPEX and $17/t operating costs.*\n\n*There is a fair bit to go through the announcement - Long story short, there looks to be a delay in the first production date mentioned months ago.*\n\n**TG1** [**identified unmapped historical workings**](/quick-takes/tg1-finds-unmapped-historic-workings-on-recently-acquired-project/) at its Dalgaranga Gold Project in WA.\n\n*TG1’s new project sits in a relatively well understood part of WA so it was a surprise to find unmapped historic workings. - a small open pit mined at 2.5g/t gold and multiple shallow workings.*\n\n*Usually these historic workings are found on remote sites - so we liked that announcement from TG1.*\n\n**L1M** [**raised $2.5M to fund drilling**](/quick-takes/l1m-raises-25m-exploration-programs-to-start-early-next-year/) on its QLD and NSW assets.\n\n*We participated in the raise and we are looking forward to Phase 2 of L1M drilling its Queensland gold asset, following up the encouraging mineralisation it hit during Phase 1 drilling in recent months.*\n\n**EIQ** has developed (and is already in the market with) an AI-powered algorithm that helps cardiologists detect heart diseases.\n\nEIQ’s tech is already USA FDA approved AND being used by a growing number of hospitals in the USA to detect one heart disease called Aortic Stenosis.\n\n**Earlier this week EIQ announced results of a clinical validation study on a different heart disease - Heart Failure.**\n\nHeart Failure is one of the big heart diseases - US$60BN is spent on it, 1 in 4 Americans will get it, and it's the leading cause of rehospitalisation.\n\nEIQ’s clinical validation study was run by the prestigious Mayo Clinic. The study delivered exceptional results on **detecting heart failure with 99.5% sensitivity and 91.0% specificity** ([source](\n\nMuch better than the only other AI heart failure detection software used in the market today which delivers **sensitivity of 87.8% and specificity of 81.9%** ([source](\n\n(Both technologies are a step change from current practices where only 50% of Heart Failure cases are accurately diagnosed.)\n\nIF EIQ can get FDA approval for its Heart Failure AI model, there already exists a reimbursement code the company can use to commercialise its AI tech.\n\nThe reimbursement code exists thanks to Ultromics (who [raised US$55M]( in a series C funding round valuing them at US$300M / A$464M back in July).\n\nNow we watch for FDA clearance...\n\n**IIQ** is developing an exosome platform technology.\n\nIIQ is applying its exosome platform to develop diagnostics (detecting diseases) AND therapeutics (treating diseases).\n\nExosomes are tiny, microscopic extra-cellular “containers” that carry ‘messages’ between the human body's cells that allows the human body to function.\n\n**IIQ is going after two types of cancer that have NO approved/recommended treatments or diagnostic tools.**\n\n* Ovarian cancer is usually asymptomatic (no symptoms) in the early stages of the disease. If a woman is diagnosed at stage 1 - the survival rates can be over 90%. If a woman is diagnosed at stages 3/4 survival rates can be ~29%. ~70% of all ovarian cancer in Australia is diagnosed as advanced [stage 3 or 4 cancer](\n\n* At the moment there are no recommended screening tests for women who show no symptoms of ovarian cancer - meaning there is no quick and easy screening test that can be regularly taken by all healthy women to catch ovarian cancer early.\n\n* **IIQ’s screening test has been able to detect all stage 1 and 2 ovarian cancers (the earliest but asymptomatic stages where survival rates are the highest), with over 99.6% specificity (catching 99.6% of all patients with cancer) AND NO misdiagnosis.**\n\n* **What’s Next:** IIQ to do a larger clinical validation study (to see if the test works on a larger cohort of patients) then look at “strategic partnering” to commercialise the screening tool.\n\n* Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of breast cancer that does NOT respond to traditional breast cancer therapies.\n\n* At the moment, there are no approved cell therapies treating triple negative breast cancer.\n\n* IIQ is developing the therapeutic under a deal signed with the prestigious Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Peter Mac) in Melbourne. The institution is among only a handful globally that combines a dedicated cancer hospital with a fully integrated cancer research program.\n\n* **So far IIQ has shown that its therapeutic was able to kill more than 90% of the cancer cells within 10 hours of treatment in in vitro studies (in a laboratory setting).**\n\n* **What’s next:** Next for the therapeutic is the results from animal studies (in-vivo) due this quarter.\n\nWe think that any solid tumour therapeutic IIQ is able to develop could be a game changer for the company.\n\nMainly because it would de-risk IIQ’s platform tech (if it works for one cancer, why wouldn't it work for others?)...\n\nWe called **BKB** our 2025 Next Investors Small Cap Pick of the Year because it acquired 100% of a previously producing, high grade silver project, in Texas, USA.\n\nWhile it sits in Texas USA, geologically, it actually sits on Mexico’s famous Sierra Madre belt, which is home to some of the world’s biggest silver producers.\n\n**We want to see BKB get this project back into production as quickly as possible, while silver prices are at all time highs** (we think the silver price could go on a generational run over the coming years and have positioned our Portfolio for this scenario).\n\nAND in the nearer term, we want to see the BKB team execute on their plan to restart their silver mine and processing plant in Texas while drilling out to grow their in ground silver resource.\n\nThis week BKB announced high grade rock chips OUTSIDE of the existing silver resource (grades up to 3,100 g/t silver):\n\nSilver gapped up almost 10% this week so all eyes on the open for this one tomorrow.\n\n**EXR** is the biggest net acreage holder in the Taroom Trough - second only to supermajor $320BN Shell.\n\nEXR just did a deal with the #3 landholder in the region - Omega Oil and Gas.\n\nOmega took a 19.43% position in EXR in exchange for $13.9M at 4.1c per share.\n\nOmega is backed by Tri-Star (pioneers of the Queensland gas industry) and it recently did a deal with ~$2.8BN Beach Energy.\n\nAfter all is said and done EXR will have a $35.3M capital budget to work with.\n\nAND next, EXR is drilling a vertical well targeting a ~1 trillion cubic feet of contingent gas resource (estimate).\n\nDrilling starts in January...\n\nAnd then a horizontal section, with stimulating and testing will follow straight after.\n\nIt all kicks off on the 12th of January according to the EXR MD and CEO Stuart Nicholls in a webinar a few days ago. ([Source - watch it here](\n\nWe also noticed that were two specific conditions as part of Omega’s investment in EXR.\n\nFirst the “standstill” - which means Omega can’t buy any more shares in EXR for at least 12 months - basically EXR is given a 12-month period to deliver material catalysts (like the Lorelle drilling and horizontal well)...\n\nAnd second, the support condition - which basically means if EXR were to attract a takeover offer within the next 12 months from someone OTHER THAN Omega, Omega wouldn't be able to block the transaction (UNLESS they are willing to match/beat the proposal).\n\nWe think this is a very good deal for EXR shareholders, especially if the January drill results come in...\n\n**After this week’s deal, the clear front runners in the Taroom Trough are EXR/Omega and then $320BN Shell...**\n\n**Bloomberg -** While stablecoins are set on revolutionising payments, [**200-year-old lessons from America's free-banking era**]( could determine whether they survive real-world financial stress.\n\n**Bloomberg -** Global silver market tightens as [**China’s stockpiles plummet to decade-low**]( record exports surge, and near-term prices climb in backwardation.\n\n**Bloomberg -** Beijing [**mixes trade power and diplomacy at G-20**]( curbing rare earth exports while rolling out a new international mining initiative.\n\n**Mining.com -** [**US backs Brazil’s Serra Verde**]( with $465M funding to boost rare earth production, cutting Western reliance on China for critical minerals.\n\nThat isn't the first time US capital has made its way into Brazilian rare earths space... good news for our Investment in Brazil [**SGQ**](/company/asx-sgq/).\n\n**Bloomberg -** UK unveils plan to produce 10% of critical minerals domestically and [**recycle 20% by 2035**]( with £50M backing local industry.\n\n*Our Investment* [***ION***](/company/asx-ion/) *is currently getting its foot in the door in the US and has already taken early steps toward doing the same in Europe...*\n\n**Reuters -** EXIM announces [**$100BN investment to stabilize US and allied critical minerals**]( nuclear, and LNG supply chains amid global shortages.\n\n**The Telegraph -** A [**Marburg virus outbreak in Ethiopia**]( has already killed five and is spreading fast near Kenyan and South Sudan’s borders, experts warn of high fatality risk.\n\n*A terrible disease that we hope one day our Investment ILA’s Marburg drug can help tackle:* [***ILA: Our Biotech Pick of the Year***](/articles/ila-our-biotech-pick-of-the-year/)\n\n[***Mithril Silver and Gold (ASX: MTH) - Updated Resource for Silver Gold Project in Mexico Coming in Q1 2026***](\n\n[***Echo IQ (ASX: EIQ) - Investor Briefing: Exceptional Results for EchoSolv HF Validation Study***](\n\n[***One of America’s Biggest Gold Wholesalers Exposes the Most Common Gold Scam Enslaving the Country***](\n\n[**Locksley Resources (ASX: LKY | OTCQX: LKYRF) CEO Kerrie Matthews was on site and getting amongst the flurry of activity underway at its Mojave project in California**](\n\n## A word of caution...\n\nWhile we aim to highlight developments in the small cap space, investing in early-stage and small cap companies - like those we cover - is inherently risky.\n\nThese companies often face funding challenges, regulatory hurdles, and market volatility.

As such, developing these is crucial to energy transition as it helps provide the materials needed for solar panels, wind turbines and batteries.\n\nThe project is understood to boast over 400,000 tonnes of total rare earth oxide alongside a “world-class” mineral sands resource, making it one of Australia’s most significant [critical minerals projects](\n\nNews of work plan approval comes after Victoria’s critical minerals future was advanced with the [approval of an exploration tunnel at the Sunday Creek]( antimony and gold projects, highlighting a shift in focus from both mining companies and industry bodies.\n\nDescribed as one of Victoria’s “most significant mineral sands and rare earths projects”, Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio noted the move goes beyond simply critical mineral capabilities across Victoria.\n\n“Critical minerals development in the Wimmera and Mallee could support up to 7,000 new jobs in the coming decades, and we are backing local communities with these well-paying jobs,” she said.\n\nThe [approval]( forms part of the Labor government’s Critical Minerals Roadmap set out last year to unlock the state’s critical minerals potential.\",0.9\nrare earth,The Capital Crunch: VHM enters last stage of financing - Mining.com.au,https://mining.com.au/the-capital-crunch-vhm-enters-last-stage-of-financing-package/,\"A number of resources companies announced capital raises to end the last week of November, including [VHM]( (ASX:VHM), which opened a share purchase plan to raise $1 million, following its $10.3 million placement to fund exploration at the Goschen Project in Victoria.\n\nShares will be issued at $0.35 each, which is the same conditions as the placement.\n\nVHM closed its placement on 24 November to fund early engineering works, finalise land acquisition, and operating costs ahead of offtake and financing arrangements for a final investment decision, due in H1 2026.\n\nVHM is a mineral explorer focused on developing its Goshchen Project to produce rare earths and mineral sands.\n\n[Zeotech]( (ASX:ZEO) has received a refund of $960,762 cash from the Australian Government’s Research and Development (R&D) Tax Incentive Program for the financial year ending 30 June 2025.\n\nThe company received this cash payment in regards to development of its metakaolin research for low-carbon cement and concrete from the Toondoon Kaolin Project, located 20km south of Mundubbera, Queensland.\n\nThe refund also covers Zeotech’s proprietary mineral processing technology for the production of zeolites, as well as controlling methane emissions produced in field trials and the development of technology.\n\nZeotech, which has a market capitalisation of $168.53 million, repaid a $1 million loan for R&D activities on 31 October 2025, which was first secured in March 2025.\n\nThe Australian Government’s R&D Tax Incentive Program refunds Australian companies for eligible activities to support local innovation.\n\nZeotech is focused on leveraging kaolin resources to produce high-reactivity metakaolin for the concrete market and advanced materials for greenhouse gas mitigation.\n\n[Surface Metals]( (CSE:SUR) has closed its first tranche of a C$800,000 ($1.22 million) non-brokered private placement.\n\nThe company received C$320,000 in the first tranche, issuing 1.6 million units at C$0.20, with each unit comprising one share and one-half purchase warrant.\n\nEach whole warrant allows the holder to purchase one additional share at C$0.40 over a two-year period.\n\nAs [reported]( by *Mining.com.au*, proceeds will be used to fund technical work at the Cimarron Gold Project, as well as the Clayton and Fish Lake Valley lithium projects, all located in Nevada, US.\n\nSurface Metals is a gold and lithium explorer focused on acquiring and developing projects in North America.\n\nMaddison is a recent journalism and business graduate with a passion for crafting impactful stories.

They're not hard to find if you know where to look. Such stocks with [multibagger]( potential are often hidden among leaders in fast-growing industries, first movers in industries with exponential potential, and innovative start-ups that are shaping the future.\n\nTwo such stocks have caught my attention. Each has such compelling growth prospects that buying them now and holding them could yield monster returns over the next five years or so.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRare-earth elements technically aren't rare, but it's not easy to extract them in ways that are economically viable. China has a monopoly, accounting for almost 70% of the global rare-earth extraction. That also means [80% of the rare-earth elements consumed in the U.S.]( are imported, with nearly all of them coming from China.\n\nThat's not a great place to be. Rare-earth elements are vital for electronics, semiconductors, robotics, [defense]( and aerospace technologies, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and more. However, China's dominance poses significant supply risks to the U.S. Additionally, it has always disincentivized U.S. [mining]( companies from pouring money into rare-earth elements. President Donald Trump wants to change that and, therefore, has allocated billions of dollars to critical mineral projects, even buying stakes in some domestic producers to secure U.S. supply chains.\n\nThere is only one active rare-earth mine in the U.S.: the Mountain Pass in California, owned and operated by **MP Materials** ([MP](/quote/nyse/mp/) +2.99%).\n\nIn July 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense, rebranded as the Department of War (DOW) by Trump, acquired a 15% stake in MP Materials and became its largest shareholder. MP Materials will build a rare-earth magnet manufacturing facility, known as the 10X facility, with the DOW committing to purchase 100% of the rare-earth magnets produced at the facility for 10 years. Two of its other major deals include:\n\n* A $500 million multiyear agreement with tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](/quote/nasdaq/aapl/) +0.46%) to supply magnets.\n\n* A partnership with the DOW and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to develop a rare-earth refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nMP Materials currently produces rare-earth oxides and metals and will begin production of magnets by the end of 2025. [MP Materials stock already carries a market cap of $10 billion]( but that could look minuscule five years from now.\n\nShares of **Symbotic** ([SYM](/quote/nasdaq/sym/) 4.04%) have surged over 250% so far in 2025, as of this writing. And there could be a lot more to come.\n\nSymbotic automates warehouses and distribution centers with [artificial intelligence (AI)]( [robotics]( that can move, store, and sort items. Symbotic went public in 2022 but has been working with **Walmart** ([WMT](/quote/nyse/wmt/) +1.31%) since 2015 to deploy robotic systems at multiple distribution centers. In January 2025, Symbotic acquired Walmart's advanced systems and robotics (ASR) business for automated fulfillment of orders, a new product category for Symbotic.\n\nUnder yet another new and recent agreement, Symbotic will develop and install automated micro-fulfillment systems for online pickup and delivery at Walmart's retail stores. Symbotic expects its first prototype to be ready in 2026. Meanwhile, Symbotic is developing a next-generation storage technology as well. Besides Walmart, Symbotic's other customers include **Albertsons**, C&S Wholesale Grocers, GreenBox, and **Target**.\n\nSymbotic has also just announced something big: It has signed up Medline as a customer, marking its foray into healthcare. [Medline is a major distributor of medical supplies]( in the U.S. and is expected to go public soon. Symbotic deployed its first system to Medline last quarter.\n\nSymbotic's entry into healthcare marks a significant milestone, as it opens up a new vertical for the company beyond retail and could fast-track its sales growth. Symbotic just posted a 26% growth in revenue for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 27, 2025, and projects similar growth for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.\n\nMost importantly, Symbotic ended the year with a backlog of $22.5 billion. That's huge, as it represents nearly a decade's worth of sales. So, even though Symbotic's market cap has surpassed $50 billion, its estimated addressable market runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars, making it a solid stock to own for the long term.\n\nBoth MP Materials and Symbotic share a common link -- they have the first-mover advantage in their respective industries, *and* both industries have exponential growth potential. That's what makes these stocks so appealing. Growth stocks carry their share of risks, but with both Symbotic and MP Materials already generating revenue and striking significant partnerships, they're worth the risk.\n\nNeha Chamaria is a contributing Motley Fool stock market analyst covering energy, industrials, utilities, and materials sectors, with a focus on dividend stocks.

On the first day we’re diving into one gift that set the tone of the year for critical minerals explorer [Iltani Resources]( (ASX:ILT).\n\nSince June 2023, the company has focused exploration efforts at the Orient deposit near Herberton in Far North Queensland, uncovering its prospectivity to produce silver, lead, zinc, and indium.\n\nEarlier this year, Iltani’s efforts paid off when the company flagged the asset to potentially be one of the *“highest-grade known silver-indium”* deposits, emerging as one of 2025’s brightest lights in critical minerals exploration, as [reported]( by *Mining.com.au*.\n\nThe project comprises two main areas of focus – Orient East and Orient West – within the greater Herberton Project, which spans around 367km2 in the Herberton Mineral Field.\n\nThe combined deposits have returned a maiden resource estimate of 62.5 million tonnes @ 81.5 grams per tonne silver-equivalent at a 30g/t cut-off grade, with a higher grade core of 34.2 million tonnes @ 110.4g/t silver-equivalent with a 60g/t cut-off grade – the kind worth placing under any explorer’s Christmas tree.\n\nOrient East hosts a resource of 19.8 million tonnes @ 98g/t silver-equivalent, with a higher grade core of 12.6 million tonnes @ 128g/t silver-equivalent, as [reported](\n\nOn the return of recent versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) target drilling at the project, Iltani says Orient has demonstrated potential to materially increase the mineral resource.\n\n*Mining.com.au* [reports]( across a 10-hole shallow campaign, the first hole (ORR128) delivered multiple intersections of *“thick”* silver-lead-zinc-indium mineralisation, 450m north of the Orient East resource zone.\n\nMineralisation remains open along strike and down-dip, which is believed to upgrade the resource substantially.\n\nIltani has received its final assay results from VTEM drilling, such as 20m @ 93.8 grams per tonne silver-equivalent (AgEq) from 4m, including 6m @ 132g/t AgEq from 18m; 3m @ 130.9g/t AgEq from 170m, including 1m @ 279.3g/t AgEq from 171m.\n\nThe company is now conducting a surface electromagnetic (EM) survey at the Orient to target deeper anomalies generated by VTEM drilling, as [reported](\n\nSpeaking to *Mining.com.au* on the sidelines of the [Noosa Mining Investor Conference]( Iltani Managing Director Donald Garner says the main revenue drivers for the project are silver, then followed by zinc, lead, and indium in that order.\n\n*“As long as gold sees high, silver will see high,”* Garner tells this news service.\n\nAs the festive season approaches, silver has been enjoying its own holiday cheer, marked at US$49.99 per ounce as of 24 November 2025, indicating a 73.12% for the commodity’s value from this year to date [according]( to Trading Economics.\n\nZinc on the other hand is priced at US$3,010, almost at a 1% increase for this year-to-date.\n\n*“Zinc recently almost touched a dollar fifty a pound, which is really good to see. The Zinc TCs treatment charges are low, which is also good,”* Garner adds.\n\n*“If we are successful with the permitting and development process, we’ll be in production in three or four years’ time.”*\n\nAt the same conference, Garner describes sentiment to be high ahead of the year’s end for miners across different commodities.\n\n*“There’s a resurgence in commodity prices, gold sales in particular, but the base metals are doing well and you’ve got this increasing interest in critical minerals,”* Garner mentions.\n\n*“They want to see mining in the state. They want to see value created in the state, jobs, revenues – it’s a really good time to be working in Queensland.”*\n\nIltani is [receiving]( an $8 million investment from the Queensland Investment Corporation’s (QIC) Critical Minerals and Battery Technology Fund (QCMBTF) to further develop the Orient Project.\n\nThe total grant comprises $6 million in cash in exchange for a 2% royalty on future product sales from the greater Herberton Project if commercial production begins by the end of 2030, otherwise boosting to 2.5%, as well as $2 million cash for the issue of 5.41 million shares.\n\nShares will be issued at $0.37 each, indicating a 10% discount to the 20-day volume weighted average price prior to the agreement.\n\n*“Now with the funding from the QIC, we’ll build on what we’ve got and do more,”* Garner adds.\n\nThe QIC is a state government-owned corporation that manages the QCMBTF to bolster businesses focused on supporting Queensland’s critical minerals supply chain, holding $131.6 billion worth of assets under management as of 30 June 2025.\n\nGarner explains that while the Iltani’s main priority is exploring the Orient Project, the company is always looking for opportunities to *“create value for shareholders”.*\n\n*“If we don’t look, we won’t find and you’ll never know when we’ll come across one of those,”* Garner says.\n\n*“We’re growing the team at Orient to make sure we deliver the best possible project for our shareholders and for Queensland.”*\n\nThe company will focus on drill targets inside the Caldera Complex including the Boonmoo gold and Union Jack base metal targets, before mapping the Orient and Antimony Reward projects.\n\n*“Once we understand the controls of the mineralisation, we might go back to Antimony Reward but our main focus is at Orient,”* Garner tells [*Mining.com.au*](\n\nThe Antimony Reward deposit sits roughly 17km from Orient, also within the Herberton Project in Queensland.\n\nIltani completed initial drilling at the asset in 2024, with assays [returning]( 7m @ 7.61% antimony from 38m, including 3m @ 8.19% from 38m and 1m @ 26.70% from 43m in hole ARRC001.\n\nHole ARRC003 intersected 3m @ 0.75% antimony from 31m, including 1m @ 1.25% from 32m; and 4m @ 0.43%, including 1m @ 1.28% from 42m, while hole ARRC004 intersected 9m @ 0.94% from 53m, including 2m @ 2.66% from 60m.\n\nIltani Resources is a mineral explorer focused on the discovery and development of critical minerals for a clean energy future.\n\nAs day one of *Mining.com.au*’s 12 days of Christmas series comes to a close, Iltani’s discovery highs in 2025 sets the tone for the next year and the next door on our advent calendar.\n\nMaddison is a recent journalism and business graduate with a passion for crafting impactful stories.

They're not hard to find if you know where to look. Such stocks with [multibagger]( potential are often hidden among leaders in fast-growing industries, first movers in industries with exponential potential, and innovative start-ups that are shaping the future.\n\nTwo such stocks have caught my attention. Each has such compelling growth prospects that buying them now and holding them could yield monster returns over the next five years or so.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRare-earth elements technically aren't rare, but it's not easy to extract them in ways that are economically viable. China has a monopoly, accounting for almost 70% of the global rare-earth extraction. That also means [80% of the rare-earth elements consumed in the U.S.]( are imported, with nearly all of them coming from China.\n\nThat's not a great place to be. Rare-earth elements are vital for electronics, semiconductors, robotics, [defense]( and aerospace technologies, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and more. However, China's dominance poses significant supply risks to the U.S. Additionally, it has always disincentivized U.S. [mining]( companies from pouring money into rare-earth elements. President Donald Trump wants to change that and, therefore, has allocated billions of dollars to critical mineral projects, even buying stakes in some domestic producers to secure U.S. supply chains.\n\nThere is only one active rare-earth mine in the U.S.: the Mountain Pass in California, owned and operated by **MP Materials** ([MP](/quote/nyse/mp/) +2.99%).\n\nIn July 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense, rebranded as the Department of War (DOW) by Trump, acquired a 15% stake in MP Materials and became its largest shareholder. MP Materials will build a rare-earth magnet manufacturing facility, known as the 10X facility, with the DOW committing to purchase 100% of the rare-earth magnets produced at the facility for 10 years. Two of its other major deals include:\n\n* A $500 million multiyear agreement with tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](/quote/nasdaq/aapl/) +0.46%) to supply magnets.\n\n* A partnership with the DOW and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to develop a rare-earth refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nMP Materials currently produces rare-earth oxides and metals and will begin production of magnets by the end of 2025. [MP Materials stock already carries a market cap of $10 billion]( but that could look minuscule five years from now.\n\nShares of **Symbotic** ([SYM](/quote/nasdaq/sym/) 4.04%) have surged over 250% so far in 2025, as of this writing. And there could be a lot more to come.\n\nSymbotic automates warehouses and distribution centers with [artificial intelligence (AI)]( [robotics]( that can move, store, and sort items. Symbotic went public in 2022 but has been working with **Walmart** ([WMT](/quote/nyse/wmt/) +1.31%) since 2015 to deploy robotic systems at multiple distribution centers. In January 2025, Symbotic acquired Walmart's advanced systems and robotics (ASR) business for automated fulfillment of orders, a new product category for Symbotic.\n\nUnder yet another new and recent agreement, Symbotic will develop and install automated micro-fulfillment systems for online pickup and delivery at Walmart's retail stores. Symbotic expects its first prototype to be ready in 2026. Meanwhile, Symbotic is developing a next-generation storage technology as well. Besides Walmart, Symbotic's other customers include **Albertsons**, C&S Wholesale Grocers, GreenBox, and **Target**.\n\nSymbotic has also just announced something big: It has signed up Medline as a customer, marking its foray into healthcare. [Medline is a major distributor of medical supplies]( in the U.S. and is expected to go public soon. Symbotic deployed its first system to Medline last quarter.\n\nSymbotic's entry into healthcare marks a significant milestone, as it opens up a new vertical for the company beyond retail and could fast-track its sales growth. Symbotic just posted a 26% growth in revenue for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 27, 2025, and projects similar growth for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.\n\nMost importantly, Symbotic ended the year with a backlog of $22.5 billion. That's huge, as it represents nearly a decade's worth of sales. So, even though Symbotic's market cap has surpassed $50 billion, its estimated addressable market runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars, making it a solid stock to own for the long term.\n\nBoth MP Materials and Symbotic share a common link -- they have the first-mover advantage in their respective industries, *and* both industries have exponential growth potential. That's what makes these stocks so appealing. Growth stocks carry their share of risks, but with both Symbotic and MP Materials already generating revenue and striking significant partnerships, they're worth the risk.\n\nNeha Chamaria is a contributing Motley Fool stock market analyst covering energy, industrials, utilities, and materials sectors, with a focus on dividend stocks.

[Yttrium]( (Y), [terbium]( (Tb), [erbium]( (Er), and [ytterbium]( (Yb) are all named after the village.\n\nOther elements including holmium, gadolinium, scandium, tantalum, and thulium were first discovered there, making Ytterby the richest source of naturally occurring elements on Earth.\n\nBack in 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius discovered a strange, unusually heavy black ore in an old quarry near Ytterby. This new ore was named by Arrhenius as ytterbite.\n\nTwo years later, a Finnish chemist identified from Arrhenius’ initial sample the first rare earth element – named yttrium. In just over 50 years following Arrhenius’ original discovery, Carl Gustav Mosander found that ytterbite was actually a mixture of three metal oxides, and a fourth was later discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac from the original sample.\n\nEventually as refining techniques improved, more new elements were discovered and ultimately over the next 100 years since Arrhenius’ discovery, nine more elements fell out of this strange, unusually heavy black ore.\n\nAmong these hard-to-pronounce elements is yttrium – a soft, grey-white metal that is fairly stable in air but reacts with water, acids, and bases.\n\nIt occurs in other ‘rare earth’ minerals, monazite and bastnaesite, though xenotime, which is mined in China and Malaysia, can contain up to 50% yttrium phosphate, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nYttrium metal is produced by reducing yttrium fluoride with calcium metal and is often used as an additive in alloys for its strengthening properties. When alloyed with aluminum, magnesium, and chromium, it acts to strengthen those metals.\n\nIn addition to its applications in speciality alloys found in engines, yttrium is used in coatings to shield against high temperatures.\n\nYttrium oxide is added to glass used to produce camera lenses as it makes them heat and shock resistant. It’s found in white LED lights as well as superconductors and lasers, with yttrium oxysulfide widely sought to produce red phosphors for old-style colour television tubes.\n\nLasers that can cut through metals require yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG), marking yet another of its many applications in everyday life.\n\nWhile its origins may come from Sweden, like other rare earths and critical minerals, China dominates global production and supply of yttrium. China supplies the US 93% of its yttrium imports, creating acute vulnerability across Western supply chains.\n\nThe world’s supplies are now running low due to Chinese export restrictions, sparking fears of looming protracted shortages, and rocketing costs that could hit every sector from aerospace, to energy and semiconductor production.\n\nOn the back of China restricting yttrium exports (along with six other rare earths in April in retaliation to the US tariffs) yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) prices have been soaring more than 4,000% in Europe in 2025.\n\nRecently, prices surpassed US$275/kg, as China’s tightening export controls disrupt global supply chains for military and defence, aerospace, semiconductors, and advanced materials. These shortages are also affecting markets related to high-temperature alloys, laser systems, avionics, and defence components.\n\nMagnet rare earth prices also remain high, with Benchmark reporting Dy oxide (DDP China) at over US$200/kg and Tb oxide (DDP China) at almost US$1,000/kg.\n\n[Victory Metals]( (ASX:VTM) CEO Brendan Clark says this global backdrop highlights the company’s strategic positioning as a major future yttrium supplier with what’s emerging as a valuable heavy rare earth basket.\n\nThe company’s current mineral resource hosts over 35 million kilograms of Y₂O₃ with forecast production targets over 600 tonnes annually tonnes along with strategic critical minerals dysprosium, terbium, neodymium and praseodymium, gallium, hafnium, and scandium.\n\nClark says yttrium is emerging as one of the world’s most important critical minerals and this global supply crunch is happening much faster than anyone expected.\n\n*“Our North Stanmore deposit continues to demonstrate the scale, grade, and mineralogy required to supply Western nations with secure, long-term yttrium supply,”* the CEO adds.\n\nVictory is now advancing discussions with multiple strategic partners across the defence, aerospace, automotive, and semiconductor sectors seeking secure non-Chinese heavy rare earth supply.\n\nClark says the surge in yttrium pricing materially enhances Victory’s Prefeasibility Study (PFS), with the company continuing to integrate high value heavy rare earths including yttrium, dysprosium, terbium, and recently confirmed gallium into its economic modelling.\n\nThe CEO recently told shareholders at the company’s AGM that China’s moves to ban the export of key defence-related minerals such as terbium, dysprosium and scandium is an opportunity for Victory Metals to demonstrate its capability to produce these critical materials at scale and to help Australia become a key player in the global energy transition.\n\n*“We expect the PFS will define the processing pathway, costs, and production strategy for the North Stanmore project, and demonstrate how the underlying resources can be turned into a commercial, scalable operation,”* Clark says.\n\nClark notes an exhaustive PFS into Victory’s flagship North Stanmore Project, near Cue in Western Australia’s Mid West region, continues to indicate the project’s potential as one of the most advanced heavy rare earth clay-hosted deposits.\n\n> ***“We are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements”***\n\n*“Indications are we can avoid complex cracking or additional capital-intensive processing and environmental impacts, which further strengthens our value as a secure, reliable and capable potential supplier of high-purity feedstock to global processors,”* the CEO adds.\n\n*“With minimal processing under our proposed operating model, we are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements.”*\n\nOver the past 12 months, Clark says Victory has attracted strong international and institutional backing, and significant interest from government and private sector defence manufacturers around the world seeking secure off-take agreements.\n\nIn August 2025, the company raised $11.5 million through a placement of new shares to institutional, professional and sophisticated investors.\n\nIn October, Victory signed a non-binding LoI with Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation to advance offtake and strategic cooperation for North Stanmore, covering up to 30% of annual production, including up to 50 tonnes of Dy-Tb product over an initial five-year term.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank has also offered an LoI regarding funding support of US$190 million.\n\nVictory Metals is among a number of Australian rare earths explorers thrust into the global spotlight, following the landmark agreement between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to facilitate the investment of the billions of dollars needed to establish secure and reliable rare earth and critical minerals supply chains.\n\nWith the state of the market, [ABx Group]( (ASX:ABX) has also been ramping up efforts to become a significant player in rare earths space. It’s been raising $6.05 million through a placement to fund development activities at the Deep Leads Project in Tasmania and construction of the ALCORE pilot plant.\n\nFunds will be deployed to engineering and metallurgical studies, exploration drilling for a resource increase, and to secure offtake agreements for the Deep Leads Project.\n\nProceeds will also cover construction and commissioning costs of the ALCORE pilot plant to produce hydrogen and fluoride from aluminium smelter bath waste.\n\nThe Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ([ANSTO]( has started production of ABx’s first mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) product using 50kg of a 100kg bulk sample, with completion expected before the end of November 2025.\n\nThe sample will be distributed to potential customers and offtake partners for evaluation.\n\nABx is running a program to produce a saleable MREC product from its Deep Leads ionic adsorption clay rare earth project in Tasmania to be used in downstream refining to produce separated rare earth oxides, REE metals, and magnets essential for EV motors, guidance systems, wind turbines, and other clean-energy technologies.\n\nRare earth refineries (solvent-extraction plants) commonly accept MREC because it’s a standardised, transportable feedstock from which high-purity rare earth oxides and metals can be produced.\n\nIn partnership with external engineering experts, ABx conducted a formal processing options analysis. A key conclusion is that column leach tests should be conducted to confirm that the high extractions obtained in diagnostic leach tests in tanks are also observed in a column leach arrangement.\n\nANSTO is conducting initial column leach tests planned to begin in November, with results available by early 2026.\n\nManaging Director of emerging rare earths producer [OD6 Metals]( (ASX:OD6), Brett Hazelden, believes there is plenty of opportunity for Western countries like Australia to capture a substantial share of the burgeoning market dominated by China.\n\nRecently speaking to *Mining.com.au*, Hazelden says US President Donald Trump is changing the way governments work with private industry, which reshaping how government and private partnerships can work in an investor scheme to bolster Western supply chains.\n\nIf the Western world does not want all roads leading to China, Hazelden argues they need to obviously pay a fair price that allows people to make money but also allows them to participate in the next part of the value chain as well.\n\nThe make-up of OD6’s Splinter Rock Rare Earth Elements Project in Western Australia opens up a plethora of potential end-user avenues for the minnow. The emerging rare earths producer has proven it can produce a clean, high-quality mixed rare earth carbonate, which is a product highly sought after by several end users.\n\nOD6 has now identified another avenue for consideration down the track for the production of samarium and yttrium oxides, which are both used in nuclear reactors for clean power generation and nuclear medicine.\n\nSamarium is also used in the manufacture of high-temperature samarium-cobalt magnets for headphones, electric motors and aerospace applications.\n\nIn early October, OD6 elected a preferred [flowsheet]( with the aim of producing MREC and mixed rare earth hydroxide (MREH). Flowsheet testing undertaken by ANSTO achieved a MREC recovery of about 56% total rare earth oxide (TREO), and a MREH recovery of roughly 59% TREO.\n\nThe process demonstrated low levels of aluminium, iron, phosphorus and silicon impurities, and extremely low uranium and thorium content of less than 0.001%. Overall recoveries of the most in-demand magnet rare earths, neodymium and praseodymium, reached around 75% for OD6.\n\nThe high value magnet rare earths account for 23% of the TREO grade at Splinter Rock, which hosts a resource so far of 682 million tonnes @ 1,338 parts per million for 910,000 tonnes of contained TREO. The magnet rare earths provide about 205,000 tonnes of the contained resource.\n\nMining.com.au Editor-in-Chief Adam Orlando has more than 20 years’ experience in the media having held senior roles at various publications, including as Asia-Pacific Sector Head (Mining) at global newswire Acuris (formerly Mergermarket).

China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing anytime soon.\n\nThe alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have [promised a truce over rare earth minerals]( the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.\n\nAlthough a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the [Chinese export restrictions]( introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.\n\nBut other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.\n\nYttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.\n\nThe problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.\n\nWhen Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty about delivery times. In the rare earths trade, lack of predictability is often more damaging than reduced volumes: An industry accustomed to just-in-time deliveries can be thrown into crisis by even a few weeks of delay.\n\nThe effects were immediate. In Europe, yttrium oxide prices have soared, reaching a 4,400 percent increase since the beginning of the year. Aerospace companies, which rely heavily on this material, have expressed alarm and demanded urgent measures from the US government to expand domestic production. The semiconductor industry is no less concerned: Some companies have called the situation a “serious” threat, predicting impacts on costs, efficiency, and production timelines. Gas-fired power plants, which use yttrium in the protective coatings of turbines, are also monitoring Chinese developments with increasing attention, although they maintain that they have not yet experienced disruptions.\n\nThe situation in warehouses outside China adds further layers of complexity. Available reserves, according to piecemeal estimates, range from one to 12 months, depending on the producers. Some traders have already reported running out of material; from quantities in the hundreds of tons range, many are down to just a few units. Others are completely out of stock. This volatility makes the market extremely fragile and underscores how the global supply chain depends on a small number of players.\n\nChinese exports to several countries have fallen by about 30 percent. China, which aims to become an autonomous tech powerhouse, therefore maintains a position of strength and a high degree of discretion, carefully regulating the quantities released to the international market. Moreover, the measures introduced by Beijing in the sector from the outset are flexible enough to allow it to modulate the flow of shipments according to political priorities.\n\nOn the political front, the trade truce between Washington and Beijing has yet to produce concrete results. The two sides have given negotiators until the end of November to outline clearer terms for rare earth exports to the United States, but the gap between their respective priorities remains wide. Beijing continues to work on a licensing system, inspired by mechanisms already used by the United States, that would allow for faster flow only to companies deemed to have no ties to the US military industry. This would leave many Western companies operating in the delicate boundary between civilian production and defense applications at a disadvantage, further complicating access to materials.\n\nChina's strategy involves not only controlling trade flows, but also managing technical expertise internationally. Authorities have begun requiring detailed lists of technicians specializing in rare earths, restricting their travel abroad and monitoring potential transfers of expertise to rival countries. At the same time, bans on the export of advanced rare earth processing technologies continue, a sector in which China holds a leadership position that is unlikely to be replicated in the short term. This dual approach—control of physical resources and human capital—strengthens Chinese primacy and hampers attempts to build an alternative supply chain.\n\nThe United States is nevertheless trying to fight back. New industrial projects, such as that of ReElement Technologies in Indiana, aim to produce yttrium oxide domestically starting in December, with an initial capacity of 200 tons per year, set to double within a few months. While this figure isn't enough to cover total US needs, it represents a first step toward diversification.\n\nDuring Trump's recent visit to Asia, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to jointly exploit the giant Minamitori undersea deposit, discovered years ago in the Pacific seabed. Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of a joint study to develop technologies and infrastructure capable of extracting these strategic materials from extreme ocean depths, a feat that will require enormous investment and advanced technical cooperation.\n\nYet the absence of a complete supply chain—from extraction to refining—makes the transition slow and complex. China has no intention of giving up its dominant position, a crucial and potentially decisive negotiating lever.\n\nTopics[China](/tag/china/)[manufacturing](/tag/manufacturing/)[materials](/tag/materials/)[Metal](/tag/metal/)[trade](/tag/trade/)\n\n*The Fantastic Four: First Steps*, *Thunderbolts\\**, and *Something Wicked This Way Comes* are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nGet 10% off your first order at Western Digital when you register your email.\n\nEnjoy up to 50% off deliveries, free meals, and more with the latest Home Chef coupons.\n\nYou can snag a discount on all the Pixel 10 phone varieties if you act fast.\n\nThis $400 set comes with minifigures of the complete Next Gen crew, including Picard, Riker, and Wesley Crusher’s portable tractor beam.\n\nSave hundreds on our preferred MacBook for most people.\n\nAll-Clad cookware is the best you can buy—and it has a price tag to match.

To build them, it needs materials like copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese. Most of these metals come from mines that not only tear through forests and leave toxic tailings, but are also very expensive to build and maintain.\n\n**TMC The Metals Company** (NASDAQ: TMC) is pitching a different way to obtain these [metals]( In simple terms, it wants to vacuum rocks that contain these metals (\"\"nodules\"\") off the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n***Where to invest $1,000 right now?** Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the **10 best stocks** to buy right now. [**Continue »**](\n\nExcitement about the potential for this company helped boost the stock as much as 854% in 2025; however, the [mining stock]( is down about 49% from all-time highs hit in mid-October. For long-term investors, the underlying idea behind this company could be reason enough to buy this dip.\n\nImage source: The Metals Company.\n\nThe strongest argument supporting TMC's future growth is the combined net value of about $23.6 billion of the metals it expects to extract.\n\nIn August 2025, the company published two technical assessments that assigned that multibillion-dollar value to nodules in its exploratory area. Since the company is still only valued at about $2 billion, that project value gives its dreams some real economic backing.\n\nOn top of that, TMC ended its third quarter with about $115 million in cash, which should give a couple of years of runway with its current [cash burn rate](\n\nThe catch, of course, is that TMC does *not* have regulatory approval to mine the area under its exploratory control. Indeed, although it's been making progress on that front, the concrete steps needed to finally obtain that license are somewhat opaque at this moment.\n\nIf TMC can get through the regulatory process with a valid license to mine the seafloor for nodules, TMC's 385% gain so far in 2025 will be a prologue to something much bigger. Investors who are willing to make that bet could be rewarded, although be warned: This speculative stock will likely get bumpier until the road to mining is clear.\n\n## Should you invest $1,000 in TMC The Metals Company right now?\n\nThe *Motley Fool Stock Advisor* analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks]( for investors to buy now… and TMC The Metals Company wasn’t one of them.

Another third of participants said they expect the precious metal to trade between $4,500 and $5,000 over the same timeframe, while just over 5% of those polled see prices dropping to between $3,500 and $4,000.\n\nThe investment bank surveyed more than 900 clients on its Marquee platform from Nov. 12 to 14.\n\nBuoyed in part by sustained central buying and expectations of interest-rate cuts, prices for the yellow metal have set multiple records this year, outperforming virtually every major asset class. With a year-to-date gain of about 61% to $4,223.36 as of Friday afternoon, gold is on course for its third-straight year of double-digits gains. It broke through the $4,000 mark for the first time last month.\n\nCentral bank buying of gold – picked by 38% of respondents – was seen as the main driver of gold’s increase in 2026, Goldman said. Fiscal concerns, with 27% support, ranked as the second-biggest factor.\n\nThe structural forces driving gold are far from exhausted, Sprott Asset Management argued in its November 2025 Precious Metals Report.

China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing anytime soon.\n\nThe alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have [promised a truce over rare earth minerals]( the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.\n\nAlthough a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the [Chinese export restrictions]( introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.\n\nBut other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.\n\nYttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.\n\nThe problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.\n\nWhen Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty about delivery times. In the rare earths trade, lack of predictability is often more damaging than reduced volumes: An industry accustomed to just-in-time deliveries can be thrown into crisis by even a few weeks of delay.\n\nThe effects were immediate. In Europe, yttrium oxide prices have soared, reaching a 4,400 percent increase since the beginning of the year. Aerospace companies, which rely heavily on this material, have expressed alarm and demanded urgent measures from the US government to expand domestic production. The semiconductor industry is no less concerned: Some companies have called the situation a “serious” threat, predicting impacts on costs, efficiency, and production timelines. Gas-fired power plants, which use yttrium in the protective coatings of turbines, are also monitoring Chinese developments with increasing attention, although they maintain that they have not yet experienced disruptions.\n\nThe situation in warehouses outside China adds further layers of complexity. Available reserves, according to piecemeal estimates, range from one to 12 months, depending on the producers. Some traders have already reported running out of material; from quantities in the hundreds of tons range, many are down to just a few units. Others are completely out of stock. This volatility makes the market extremely fragile and underscores how the global supply chain depends on a small number of players.\n\nChinese exports to several countries have fallen by about 30 percent. China, which aims to become an autonomous tech powerhouse, therefore maintains a position of strength and a high degree of discretion, carefully regulating the quantities released to the international market. Moreover, the measures introduced by Beijing in the sector from the outset are flexible enough to allow it to modulate the flow of shipments according to political priorities.\n\nOn the political front, the trade truce between Washington and Beijing has yet to produce concrete results. The two sides have given negotiators until the end of November to outline clearer terms for rare earth exports to the United States, but the gap between their respective priorities remains wide. Beijing continues to work on a licensing system, inspired by mechanisms already used by the United States, that would allow for faster flow only to companies deemed to have no ties to the US military industry. This would leave many Western companies operating in the delicate boundary between civilian production and defense applications at a disadvantage, further complicating access to materials.\n\nChina's strategy involves not only controlling trade flows, but also managing technical expertise internationally. Authorities have begun requiring detailed lists of technicians specializing in rare earths, restricting their travel abroad and monitoring potential transfers of expertise to rival countries. At the same time, bans on the export of advanced rare earth processing technologies continue, a sector in which China holds a leadership position that is unlikely to be replicated in the short term. This dual approach—control of physical resources and human capital—strengthens Chinese primacy and hampers attempts to build an alternative supply chain.\n\nThe United States is nevertheless trying to fight back. New industrial projects, such as that of ReElement Technologies in Indiana, aim to produce yttrium oxide domestically starting in December, with an initial capacity of 200 tons per year, set to double within a few months. While this figure isn't enough to cover total US needs, it represents a first step toward diversification.\n\nDuring Trump's recent visit to Asia, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to jointly exploit the giant Minamitori undersea deposit, discovered years ago in the Pacific seabed. Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of a joint study to develop technologies and infrastructure capable of extracting these strategic materials from extreme ocean depths, a feat that will require enormous investment and advanced technical cooperation.\n\nYet the absence of a complete supply chain—from extraction to refining—makes the transition slow and complex. China has no intention of giving up its dominant position, a crucial and potentially decisive negotiating lever.\n\nTopics[China](/tag/china/)[manufacturing](/tag/manufacturing/)[materials](/tag/materials/)[Metal](/tag/metal/)[trade](/tag/trade/)\n\n*The Fantastic Four: First Steps*, *Thunderbolts\\**, and *Something Wicked This Way Comes* are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nGet 10% off your first order at Western Digital when you register your email.\n\nEnjoy up to 50% off deliveries, free meals, and more with the latest Home Chef coupons.\n\nYou can snag a discount on all the Pixel 10 phone varieties if you act fast.\n\nThis $400 set comes with minifigures of the complete Next Gen crew, including Picard, Riker, and Wesley Crusher’s portable tractor beam.\n\nSave hundreds on our preferred MacBook for most people.\n\nAll-Clad cookware is the best you can buy—and it has a price tag to match.

[Yttrium]( (Y), [terbium]( (Tb), [erbium]( (Er), and [ytterbium]( (Yb) are all named after the village.\n\nOther elements including holmium, gadolinium, scandium, tantalum, and thulium were first discovered there, making Ytterby the richest source of naturally occurring elements on Earth.\n\nBack in 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius discovered a strange, unusually heavy black ore in an old quarry near Ytterby. This new ore was named by Arrhenius as ytterbite.\n\nTwo years later, a Finnish chemist identified from Arrhenius’ initial sample the first rare earth element – named yttrium. In just over 50 years following Arrhenius’ original discovery, Carl Gustav Mosander found that ytterbite was actually a mixture of three metal oxides, and a fourth was later discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac from the original sample.\n\nEventually as refining techniques improved, more new elements were discovered and ultimately over the next 100 years since Arrhenius’ discovery, nine more elements fell out of this strange, unusually heavy black ore.\n\nAmong these hard-to-pronounce elements is yttrium – a soft, grey-white metal that is fairly stable in air but reacts with water, acids, and bases.\n\nIt occurs in other ‘rare earth’ minerals, monazite and bastnaesite, though xenotime, which is mined in China and Malaysia, can contain up to 50% yttrium phosphate, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nYttrium metal is produced by reducing yttrium fluoride with calcium metal and is often used as an additive in alloys for its strengthening properties. When alloyed with aluminum, magnesium, and chromium, it acts to strengthen those metals.\n\nIn addition to its applications in speciality alloys found in engines, yttrium is used in coatings to shield against high temperatures.\n\nYttrium oxide is added to glass used to produce camera lenses as it makes them heat and shock resistant. It’s found in white LED lights as well as superconductors and lasers, with yttrium oxysulfide widely sought to produce red phosphors for old-style colour television tubes.\n\nLasers that can cut through metals require yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG), marking yet another of its many applications in everyday life.\n\nWhile its origins may come from Sweden, like other rare earths and critical minerals, China dominates global production and supply of yttrium. China supplies the US 93% of its yttrium imports, creating acute vulnerability across Western supply chains.\n\nThe world’s supplies are now running low due to Chinese export restrictions, sparking fears of looming protracted shortages, and rocketing costs that could hit every sector from aerospace, to energy and semiconductor production.\n\nOn the back of China restricting yttrium exports (along with six other rare earths in April in retaliation to the US tariffs) yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) prices have been soaring more than 4,000% in Europe in 2025.\n\nRecently, prices surpassed US$275/kg, as China’s tightening export controls disrupt global supply chains for military and defence, aerospace, semiconductors, and advanced materials. These shortages are also affecting markets related to high-temperature alloys, laser systems, avionics, and defence components.\n\nMagnet rare earth prices also remain high, with Benchmark reporting Dy oxide (DDP China) at over US$200/kg and Tb oxide (DDP China) at almost US$1,000/kg.\n\n[Victory Metals]( (ASX:VTM) CEO Brendan Clark says this global backdrop highlights the company’s strategic positioning as a major future yttrium supplier with what’s emerging as a valuable heavy rare earth basket.\n\nThe company’s current mineral resource hosts over 35 million kilograms of Y₂O₃ with forecast production targets over 600 tonnes annually tonnes along with strategic critical minerals dysprosium, terbium, neodymium and praseodymium, gallium, hafnium, and scandium.\n\nClark says yttrium is emerging as one of the world’s most important critical minerals and this global supply crunch is happening much faster than anyone expected.\n\n*“Our North Stanmore deposit continues to demonstrate the scale, grade, and mineralogy required to supply Western nations with secure, long-term yttrium supply,”* the CEO adds.\n\nVictory is now advancing discussions with multiple strategic partners across the defence, aerospace, automotive, and semiconductor sectors seeking secure non-Chinese heavy rare earth supply.\n\nClark says the surge in yttrium pricing materially enhances Victory’s Prefeasibility Study (PFS), with the company continuing to integrate high value heavy rare earths including yttrium, dysprosium, terbium, and recently confirmed gallium into its economic modelling.\n\nThe CEO recently told shareholders at the company’s AGM that China’s moves to ban the export of key defence-related minerals such as terbium, dysprosium and scandium is an opportunity for Victory Metals to demonstrate its capability to produce these critical materials at scale and to help Australia become a key player in the global energy transition.\n\n*“We expect the PFS will define the processing pathway, costs, and production strategy for the North Stanmore project, and demonstrate how the underlying resources can be turned into a commercial, scalable operation,”* Clark says.\n\nClark notes an exhaustive PFS into Victory’s flagship North Stanmore Project, near Cue in Western Australia’s Mid West region, continues to indicate the project’s potential as one of the most advanced heavy rare earth clay-hosted deposits.\n\n> ***“We are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements”***\n\n*“Indications are we can avoid complex cracking or additional capital-intensive processing and environmental impacts, which further strengthens our value as a secure, reliable and capable potential supplier of high-purity feedstock to global processors,”* the CEO adds.\n\n*“With minimal processing under our proposed operating model, we are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements.”*\n\nOver the past 12 months, Clark says Victory has attracted strong international and institutional backing, and significant interest from government and private sector defence manufacturers around the world seeking secure off-take agreements.\n\nIn August 2025, the company raised $11.5 million through a placement of new shares to institutional, professional and sophisticated investors.\n\nIn October, Victory signed a non-binding LoI with Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation to advance offtake and strategic cooperation for North Stanmore, covering up to 30% of annual production, including up to 50 tonnes of Dy-Tb product over an initial five-year term.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank has also offered an LoI regarding funding support of US$190 million.\n\nVictory Metals is among a number of Australian rare earths explorers thrust into the global spotlight, following the landmark agreement between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to facilitate the investment of the billions of dollars needed to establish secure and reliable rare earth and critical minerals supply chains.\n\nWith the state of the market, [ABx Group]( (ASX:ABX) has also been ramping up efforts to become a significant player in rare earths space. It’s been raising $6.05 million through a placement to fund development activities at the Deep Leads Project in Tasmania and construction of the ALCORE pilot plant.\n\nFunds will be deployed to engineering and metallurgical studies, exploration drilling for a resource increase, and to secure offtake agreements for the Deep Leads Project.\n\nProceeds will also cover construction and commissioning costs of the ALCORE pilot plant to produce hydrogen and fluoride from aluminium smelter bath waste.\n\nThe Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ([ANSTO]( has started production of ABx’s first mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) product using 50kg of a 100kg bulk sample, with completion expected before the end of November 2025.\n\nThe sample will be distributed to potential customers and offtake partners for evaluation.\n\nABx is running a program to produce a saleable MREC product from its Deep Leads ionic adsorption clay rare earth project in Tasmania to be used in downstream refining to produce separated rare earth oxides, REE metals, and magnets essential for EV motors, guidance systems, wind turbines, and other clean-energy technologies.\n\nRare earth refineries (solvent-extraction plants) commonly accept MREC because it’s a standardised, transportable feedstock from which high-purity rare earth oxides and metals can be produced.\n\nIn partnership with external engineering experts, ABx conducted a formal processing options analysis. A key conclusion is that column leach tests should be conducted to confirm that the high extractions obtained in diagnostic leach tests in tanks are also observed in a column leach arrangement.\n\nANSTO is conducting initial column leach tests planned to begin in November, with results available by early 2026.\n\nManaging Director of emerging rare earths producer [OD6 Metals]( (ASX:OD6), Brett Hazelden, believes there is plenty of opportunity for Western countries like Australia to capture a substantial share of the burgeoning market dominated by China.\n\nRecently speaking to *Mining.com.au*, Hazelden says US President Donald Trump is changing the way governments work with private industry, which reshaping how government and private partnerships can work in an investor scheme to bolster Western supply chains.\n\nIf the Western world does not want all roads leading to China, Hazelden argues they need to obviously pay a fair price that allows people to make money but also allows them to participate in the next part of the value chain as well.\n\nThe make-up of OD6’s Splinter Rock Rare Earth Elements Project in Western Australia opens up a plethora of potential end-user avenues for the minnow. The emerging rare earths producer has proven it can produce a clean, high-quality mixed rare earth carbonate, which is a product highly sought after by several end users.\n\nOD6 has now identified another avenue for consideration down the track for the production of samarium and yttrium oxides, which are both used in nuclear reactors for clean power generation and nuclear medicine.\n\nSamarium is also used in the manufacture of high-temperature samarium-cobalt magnets for headphones, electric motors and aerospace applications.\n\nIn early October, OD6 elected a preferred [flowsheet]( with the aim of producing MREC and mixed rare earth hydroxide (MREH). Flowsheet testing undertaken by ANSTO achieved a MREC recovery of about 56% total rare earth oxide (TREO), and a MREH recovery of roughly 59% TREO.\n\nThe process demonstrated low levels of aluminium, iron, phosphorus and silicon impurities, and extremely low uranium and thorium content of less than 0.001%. Overall recoveries of the most in-demand magnet rare earths, neodymium and praseodymium, reached around 75% for OD6.\n\nThe high value magnet rare earths account for 23% of the TREO grade at Splinter Rock, which hosts a resource so far of 682 million tonnes @ 1,338 parts per million for 910,000 tonnes of contained TREO. The magnet rare earths provide about 205,000 tonnes of the contained resource.\n\nMining.com.au Editor-in-Chief Adam Orlando has more than 20 years’ experience in the media having held senior roles at various publications, including as Asia-Pacific Sector Head (Mining) at global newswire Acuris (formerly Mergermarket).

Notably, the sides agreed on enhanced pension system cooperation and signed a memorandum to advance veterinary services and agricultural research.\n\nKazakhstan’s National Academy of Sciences and Turkmenistan’s Academy of Sciences also agreed to increase research collaboration.\n\nAccording to [The Times of Central Asia]( Kazakhstan, long recognized for its substantial rare earth metals reserves, is moving beyond the familiar characterization of “underutilized potential” and is taking on a more active role in global critical material supply chains. The state-owned mining company Tau-Ken Samruk has become a key driver of this shift, expanding both at home and abroad.\n\nKazakhstan recently confirmed a new deposit with major reserves of cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and yttrium, strengthening its position as one of the few countries producing more than half of the known rare earth elements. The national strategy now centers on developing a full industrial cycle rather than exporting raw materials.\n\nA clear example of this change came in 2025, when Tau-Ken Samruk signed an agreement with U.S. based Cove Capital to develop the Severny Katpar and Verkhniy Kairakty tungsten deposits. A similar project with China’s Xiamen Tungsten collapsed in 2018 without binding commitments, highlighting growing geopolitical competition around Kazakhstan’s resources.\n\nThe country is also expanding internationally.

It ended its [fiscal year with $130.5 billion in revenues]( which is more than double what it made in the previous year. Its data center division alone made $115.2 billion.\n\nBy the end of November, however, the market is posing a new question: what does “dominance” mean when your largest consumers are striving to need you less?\n\nOn one side, Meta Platforms is discussing spending billions on Google’s Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs. They may start by renting capacity next year and then use TPUs in their [own data centers beginning in 2027](\n\nOn the other hand, Baidu is launching a five-year plan for AI chips to fill the gap left by Nvidia in China, where U.S. export limitations are having a big impact.\n\nSome estimates say that Nvidia still owns [between 80% and 90%]( of the AI accelerator market, while others say it may be as high as 95%.\n\nBut Meta Platforms’ latest news shows how swiftly that fortress is being put to the test, from both ends of the global AI [supply chain](\n\nThe main point of the first piece is straightforward and harsh: one of Nvidia’s major customers is seeking a new deal.\n\n* Rent Google Cloud’s TPUs starting in 2026.\n\n* Beginning in 2027, put Google TPUs in its own data centers.\n\nMeta has already revised its forecast for capital spending in 2025 [to $70 billion to $72 billion]( specifically to create AI data centers and servers. That is more than the previous range, and almost $30 billion more than what it spent in 2024 at the midpoint.\n\nTriple-digit growth meets Wall Street skepticism as Palantir battles AI bubble fears.\n\nIt matters if even a small amount of that money goes from Nvidia to Alphabet’s processors.\n\n* Nvidia still dominates the AI accelerator market, but a single hyperscaler like Meta may account for a mid-teens proportion of demand.\n\n* Depending on the size and timing of the deployments, some estimates suggest that a Meta–TPU transaction may cost Nvidia up to 10% of its annual sales.\n\nMarkets have noticed. Nvidia’s market value has [dropped by more than $700 billion]( since it briefly reached $5 trillion earlier this year. Alphabet’s stock has risen, bringing its market value closer to $4 trillion as [Wall Street]( begins to assign a real financial value to TPU sales.\n\nMorgan Stanley, for example, thinks that Alphabet may ship [between 500,000 and 1 million TPUs]( per year by 2027. Every additional 500,000 units would contribute around 11% to Google Cloud’s revenue and 3% to Alphabet’s profits per share.\n\nThat doesn’t eliminate Nvidia from the game overnight. But it does shift the debate from “Is it possible for anyone to catch Nvidia?” to “How much of the AI hardware market will Nvidia share with its competitors?”\n\nIf the conversations between Meta and Google are about diversifying, Baidu’s demand for chips is a matter of necessity.\n\nU.S. export restrictions already prohibit Nvidia from sending its best GPUs to China. Reports say that Beijing has gone even further by telling people not to buy Nvidia’s less powerful H20 processors, which are available there.\n\nNetflix spent big on its biggest show. The payoff may be hiding in what viewers are rewatching right now.\n\nRecently, [Chinese officials stopped]( ByteDance from using Nvidia chips in new data centers and told state-funded projects to only utilize AI processors made in China. This means that they had to use a local alternative.\n\nThat’s where Baidu’s Kunlunxin unit comes in.\n\n* M300 chip capable of both training and inference, planned for early 2027.\n\n* New Tianchi 256 and Tianchi 512 “supernode” systems that network hundreds of Baidu chips to mimic the performance of large Nvidia clusters.\n\n* JPMorgan thinks that Baidu’s sales of AI chips would expand by around six times, reaching about 8 billion yuan (about $1.1 billion) by 2026.\n\n* Macquarie thinks that the Kunlunxin segment is worth around $28 billion on its own.\n\n* Kunlunxin has already had orders from suppliers connected to China Mobile, one of the biggest phone companies in the nation. This shows that the company is starting to get business.\n\nChinese IT companies like Alibaba and Tencent are also warning investors that the problem for the next two to three years will be a lack of AI chips, not a lack of demand. That means that any reliable domestic chip provider has a market that is almost completely theirs.\n\nThe arithmetic isn’t good for Nvidia: China has been a big market for AI accelerators, but U.S. sanctions and Chinese industrial policies are making it hard for local companies to develop around it.\n\nEven with those problems, the AI chip industry as a whole is developing so quickly that Nvidia may lose [market share]( and still make money.\n\n* The data center GPU market is projected to grow at a 13.7% annual rate from $120 billion in 2025 to $228 billion in 2030, according to at least one estimate.\n\n* One research group predicts $145.1 billion in AI GPU chip sales between 2024 and 2029, rising over 30% yearly.\n\n* Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta [spent almost $200 billion]( of a $290 billion data center infrastructure bill recently. That sum is likely to rise more than 40% in 2025 as they rush to expand AI capacity.\n\n* It made $130.5 billion in sales in fiscal 2025, which is 114% more than the year before.\n\n* S&P Global Ratings [now thinks Nvidia]( might make $205 billion in sales in fiscal 2026 and $272 billion in 2027.\n\n* Its primary operations have gross margins of 70% to 75%, which is quite high for the semiconductor industry.\n\nIn other words, the “arms race” is making the arms market bigger.\n\nThe problem for Nvidia isn’t that the pie becomes smaller. It’s that the slices become more congested. TPUs are taking a bigger share at the top end of U.S. clouds, while Baidu (and Huawei) are taking a lot of the growth in China.\n\nNvidia remains the best method to capitalize on the growth of AI infrastructure for now. But the Meta and Baidu tales show that the industry is more complicated for investors to watch:\n\n* Nvidia: Still the leading AI infrastructure play, but hyperscalers may shift workloads to in-house and competition processors.\n\n* Alphabet: TPUs are becoming a profit center; any Meta transaction will increase cloud economics and strengthen Google’s AI software and hardware dominance.\n\n* Meta Platforms: Massive AI capex is about control and growth, and TPUs boost compute security and price leverage.\n\n* Baidu: Kunlunxin presents Baidu with a unique opportunity to become China’s top AI chip manufacturer, benefiting from legislative tailwinds but facing execution and manufacturing challenges.\n\nBig picture: Nvidia no longer has a “Nvidia killer.” Regional and vertical competitors are carving out a significant portion of the fast-growing AI hardware industry. Number-loving investors must watch how quickly Nvidia is expanding and how much Alphabet and Baidu discreetly drain off over the next several years.\n\nThe \"\"Mad Money\"\" host says investors are missing something big.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a financial markets writer with nearly a decade of experience covering equities and macro-technology themes. He has contributed to TheStreet, MT Newswires, GuruFocus, and InvestorPlace, delivering breaking news, earnings coverage, and data-driven stock analysis for retail and institutional audiences.

On the first day we’re diving into one gift that set the tone of the year for critical minerals explorer [Iltani Resources]( (ASX:ILT).\n\nSince June 2023, the company has focused exploration efforts at the Orient deposit near Herberton in Far North Queensland, uncovering its prospectivity to produce silver, lead, zinc, and indium.\n\nEarlier this year, Iltani’s efforts paid off when the company flagged the asset to potentially be one of the *“highest-grade known silver-indium”* deposits, emerging as one of 2025’s brightest lights in critical minerals exploration, as [reported]( by *Mining.com.au*.\n\nThe project comprises two main areas of focus – Orient East and Orient West – within the greater Herberton Project, which spans around 367km2 in the Herberton Mineral Field.\n\nThe combined deposits have returned a maiden resource estimate of 62.5 million tonnes @ 81.5 grams per tonne silver-equivalent at a 30g/t cut-off grade, with a higher grade core of 34.2 million tonnes @ 110.4g/t silver-equivalent with a 60g/t cut-off grade – the kind worth placing under any explorer’s Christmas tree.\n\nOrient East hosts a resource of 19.8 million tonnes @ 98g/t silver-equivalent, with a higher grade core of 12.6 million tonnes @ 128g/t silver-equivalent, as [reported](\n\nOn the return of recent versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) target drilling at the project, Iltani says Orient has demonstrated potential to materially increase the mineral resource.\n\n*Mining.com.au* [reports]( across a 10-hole shallow campaign, the first hole (ORR128) delivered multiple intersections of *“thick”* silver-lead-zinc-indium mineralisation, 450m north of the Orient East resource zone.\n\nMineralisation remains open along strike and down-dip, which is believed to upgrade the resource substantially.\n\nIltani has received its final assay results from VTEM drilling, such as 20m @ 93.8 grams per tonne silver-equivalent (AgEq) from 4m, including 6m @ 132g/t AgEq from 18m; 3m @ 130.9g/t AgEq from 170m, including 1m @ 279.3g/t AgEq from 171m.\n\nThe company is now conducting a surface electromagnetic (EM) survey at the Orient to target deeper anomalies generated by VTEM drilling, as [reported](\n\nSpeaking to *Mining.com.au* on the sidelines of the [Noosa Mining Investor Conference]( Iltani Managing Director Donald Garner says the main revenue drivers for the project are silver, then followed by zinc, lead, and indium in that order.\n\n*“As long as gold sees high, silver will see high,”* Garner tells this news service.\n\nAs the festive season approaches, silver has been enjoying its own holiday cheer, marked at US$49.99 per ounce as of 24 November 2025, indicating a 73.12% for the commodity’s value from this year to date [according]( to Trading Economics.\n\nZinc on the other hand is priced at US$3,010, almost at a 1% increase for this year-to-date.\n\n*“Zinc recently almost touched a dollar fifty a pound, which is really good to see. The Zinc TCs treatment charges are low, which is also good,”* Garner adds.\n\n*“If we are successful with the permitting and development process, we’ll be in production in three or four years’ time.”*\n\nAt the same conference, Garner describes sentiment to be high ahead of the year’s end for miners across different commodities.\n\n*“There’s a resurgence in commodity prices, gold sales in particular, but the base metals are doing well and you’ve got this increasing interest in critical minerals,”* Garner mentions.\n\n*“They want to see mining in the state. They want to see value created in the state, jobs, revenues – it’s a really good time to be working in Queensland.”*\n\nIltani is [receiving]( an $8 million investment from the Queensland Investment Corporation’s (QIC) Critical Minerals and Battery Technology Fund (QCMBTF) to further develop the Orient Project.\n\nThe total grant comprises $6 million in cash in exchange for a 2% royalty on future product sales from the greater Herberton Project if commercial production begins by the end of 2030, otherwise boosting to 2.5%, as well as $2 million cash for the issue of 5.41 million shares.\n\nShares will be issued at $0.37 each, indicating a 10% discount to the 20-day volume weighted average price prior to the agreement.\n\n*“Now with the funding from the QIC, we’ll build on what we’ve got and do more,”* Garner adds.\n\nThe QIC is a state government-owned corporation that manages the QCMBTF to bolster businesses focused on supporting Queensland’s critical minerals supply chain, holding $131.6 billion worth of assets under management as of 30 June 2025.\n\nGarner explains that while the Iltani’s main priority is exploring the Orient Project, the company is always looking for opportunities to *“create value for shareholders”.*\n\n*“If we don’t look, we won’t find and you’ll never know when we’ll come across one of those,”* Garner says.\n\n*“We’re growing the team at Orient to make sure we deliver the best possible project for our shareholders and for Queensland.”*\n\nThe company will focus on drill targets inside the Caldera Complex including the Boonmoo gold and Union Jack base metal targets, before mapping the Orient and Antimony Reward projects.\n\n*“Once we understand the controls of the mineralisation, we might go back to Antimony Reward but our main focus is at Orient,”* Garner tells [*Mining.com.au*](\n\nThe Antimony Reward deposit sits roughly 17km from Orient, also within the Herberton Project in Queensland.\n\nIltani completed initial drilling at the asset in 2024, with assays [returning]( 7m @ 7.61% antimony from 38m, including 3m @ 8.19% from 38m and 1m @ 26.70% from 43m in hole ARRC001.\n\nHole ARRC003 intersected 3m @ 0.75% antimony from 31m, including 1m @ 1.25% from 32m; and 4m @ 0.43%, including 1m @ 1.28% from 42m, while hole ARRC004 intersected 9m @ 0.94% from 53m, including 2m @ 2.66% from 60m.\n\nIltani Resources is a mineral explorer focused on the discovery and development of critical minerals for a clean energy future.\n\nAs day one of *Mining.com.au*’s 12 days of Christmas series comes to a close, Iltani’s discovery highs in 2025 sets the tone for the next year and the next door on our advent calendar.\n\nMaddison is a recent journalism and business graduate with a passion for crafting impactful stories.

[Yttrium]( (Y), [terbium]( (Tb), [erbium]( (Er), and [ytterbium]( (Yb) are all named after the village.\n\nOther elements including holmium, gadolinium, scandium, tantalum, and thulium were first discovered there, making Ytterby the richest source of naturally occurring elements on Earth.\n\nBack in 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius discovered a strange, unusually heavy black ore in an old quarry near Ytterby. This new ore was named by Arrhenius as ytterbite.\n\nTwo years later, a Finnish chemist identified from Arrhenius’ initial sample the first rare earth element – named yttrium. In just over 50 years following Arrhenius’ original discovery, Carl Gustav Mosander found that ytterbite was actually a mixture of three metal oxides, and a fourth was later discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac from the original sample.\n\nEventually as refining techniques improved, more new elements were discovered and ultimately over the next 100 years since Arrhenius’ discovery, nine more elements fell out of this strange, unusually heavy black ore.\n\nAmong these hard-to-pronounce elements is yttrium – a soft, grey-white metal that is fairly stable in air but reacts with water, acids, and bases.\n\nIt occurs in other ‘rare earth’ minerals, monazite and bastnaesite, though xenotime, which is mined in China and Malaysia, can contain up to 50% yttrium phosphate, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nYttrium metal is produced by reducing yttrium fluoride with calcium metal and is often used as an additive in alloys for its strengthening properties. When alloyed with aluminum, magnesium, and chromium, it acts to strengthen those metals.\n\nIn addition to its applications in speciality alloys found in engines, yttrium is used in coatings to shield against high temperatures.\n\nYttrium oxide is added to glass used to produce camera lenses as it makes them heat and shock resistant. It’s found in white LED lights as well as superconductors and lasers, with yttrium oxysulfide widely sought to produce red phosphors for old-style colour television tubes.\n\nLasers that can cut through metals require yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG), marking yet another of its many applications in everyday life.\n\nWhile its origins may come from Sweden, like other rare earths and critical minerals, China dominates global production and supply of yttrium. China supplies the US 93% of its yttrium imports, creating acute vulnerability across Western supply chains.\n\nThe world’s supplies are now running low due to Chinese export restrictions, sparking fears of looming protracted shortages, and rocketing costs that could hit every sector from aerospace, to energy and semiconductor production.\n\nOn the back of China restricting yttrium exports (along with six other rare earths in April in retaliation to the US tariffs) yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) prices have been soaring more than 4,000% in Europe in 2025.\n\nRecently, prices surpassed US$275/kg, as China’s tightening export controls disrupt global supply chains for military and defence, aerospace, semiconductors, and advanced materials. These shortages are also affecting markets related to high-temperature alloys, laser systems, avionics, and defence components.\n\nMagnet rare earth prices also remain high, with Benchmark reporting Dy oxide (DDP China) at over US$200/kg and Tb oxide (DDP China) at almost US$1,000/kg.\n\n[Victory Metals]( (ASX:VTM) CEO Brendan Clark says this global backdrop highlights the company’s strategic positioning as a major future yttrium supplier with what’s emerging as a valuable heavy rare earth basket.\n\nThe company’s current mineral resource hosts over 35 million kilograms of Y₂O₃ with forecast production targets over 600 tonnes annually tonnes along with strategic critical minerals dysprosium, terbium, neodymium and praseodymium, gallium, hafnium, and scandium.\n\nClark says yttrium is emerging as one of the world’s most important critical minerals and this global supply crunch is happening much faster than anyone expected.\n\n*“Our North Stanmore deposit continues to demonstrate the scale, grade, and mineralogy required to supply Western nations with secure, long-term yttrium supply,”* the CEO adds.\n\nVictory is now advancing discussions with multiple strategic partners across the defence, aerospace, automotive, and semiconductor sectors seeking secure non-Chinese heavy rare earth supply.\n\nClark says the surge in yttrium pricing materially enhances Victory’s Prefeasibility Study (PFS), with the company continuing to integrate high value heavy rare earths including yttrium, dysprosium, terbium, and recently confirmed gallium into its economic modelling.\n\nThe CEO recently told shareholders at the company’s AGM that China’s moves to ban the export of key defence-related minerals such as terbium, dysprosium and scandium is an opportunity for Victory Metals to demonstrate its capability to produce these critical materials at scale and to help Australia become a key player in the global energy transition.\n\n*“We expect the PFS will define the processing pathway, costs, and production strategy for the North Stanmore project, and demonstrate how the underlying resources can be turned into a commercial, scalable operation,”* Clark says.\n\nClark notes an exhaustive PFS into Victory’s flagship North Stanmore Project, near Cue in Western Australia’s Mid West region, continues to indicate the project’s potential as one of the most advanced heavy rare earth clay-hosted deposits.\n\n> ***“We are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements”***\n\n*“Indications are we can avoid complex cracking or additional capital-intensive processing and environmental impacts, which further strengthens our value as a secure, reliable and capable potential supplier of high-purity feedstock to global processors,”* the CEO adds.\n\n*“With minimal processing under our proposed operating model, we are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements.”*\n\nOver the past 12 months, Clark says Victory has attracted strong international and institutional backing, and significant interest from government and private sector defence manufacturers around the world seeking secure off-take agreements.\n\nIn August 2025, the company raised $11.5 million through a placement of new shares to institutional, professional and sophisticated investors.\n\nIn October, Victory signed a non-binding LoI with Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation to advance offtake and strategic cooperation for North Stanmore, covering up to 30% of annual production, including up to 50 tonnes of Dy-Tb product over an initial five-year term.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank has also offered an LoI regarding funding support of US$190 million.\n\nVictory Metals is among a number of Australian rare earths explorers thrust into the global spotlight, following the landmark agreement between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to facilitate the investment of the billions of dollars needed to establish secure and reliable rare earth and critical minerals supply chains.\n\nWith the state of the market, [ABx Group]( (ASX:ABX) has also been ramping up efforts to become a significant player in rare earths space. It’s been raising $6.05 million through a placement to fund development activities at the Deep Leads Project in Tasmania and construction of the ALCORE pilot plant.\n\nFunds will be deployed to engineering and metallurgical studies, exploration drilling for a resource increase, and to secure offtake agreements for the Deep Leads Project.\n\nProceeds will also cover construction and commissioning costs of the ALCORE pilot plant to produce hydrogen and fluoride from aluminium smelter bath waste.\n\nThe Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ([ANSTO]( has started production of ABx’s first mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) product using 50kg of a 100kg bulk sample, with completion expected before the end of November 2025.\n\nThe sample will be distributed to potential customers and offtake partners for evaluation.\n\nABx is running a program to produce a saleable MREC product from its Deep Leads ionic adsorption clay rare earth project in Tasmania to be used in downstream refining to produce separated rare earth oxides, REE metals, and magnets essential for EV motors, guidance systems, wind turbines, and other clean-energy technologies.\n\nRare earth refineries (solvent-extraction plants) commonly accept MREC because it’s a standardised, transportable feedstock from which high-purity rare earth oxides and metals can be produced.\n\nIn partnership with external engineering experts, ABx conducted a formal processing options analysis. A key conclusion is that column leach tests should be conducted to confirm that the high extractions obtained in diagnostic leach tests in tanks are also observed in a column leach arrangement.\n\nANSTO is conducting initial column leach tests planned to begin in November, with results available by early 2026.\n\nManaging Director of emerging rare earths producer [OD6 Metals]( (ASX:OD6), Brett Hazelden, believes there is plenty of opportunity for Western countries like Australia to capture a substantial share of the burgeoning market dominated by China.\n\nRecently speaking to *Mining.com.au*, Hazelden says US President Donald Trump is changing the way governments work with private industry, which reshaping how government and private partnerships can work in an investor scheme to bolster Western supply chains.\n\nIf the Western world does not want all roads leading to China, Hazelden argues they need to obviously pay a fair price that allows people to make money but also allows them to participate in the next part of the value chain as well.\n\nThe make-up of OD6’s Splinter Rock Rare Earth Elements Project in Western Australia opens up a plethora of potential end-user avenues for the minnow. The emerging rare earths producer has proven it can produce a clean, high-quality mixed rare earth carbonate, which is a product highly sought after by several end users.\n\nOD6 has now identified another avenue for consideration down the track for the production of samarium and yttrium oxides, which are both used in nuclear reactors for clean power generation and nuclear medicine.\n\nSamarium is also used in the manufacture of high-temperature samarium-cobalt magnets for headphones, electric motors and aerospace applications.\n\nIn early October, OD6 elected a preferred [flowsheet]( with the aim of producing MREC and mixed rare earth hydroxide (MREH). Flowsheet testing undertaken by ANSTO achieved a MREC recovery of about 56% total rare earth oxide (TREO), and a MREH recovery of roughly 59% TREO.\n\nThe process demonstrated low levels of aluminium, iron, phosphorus and silicon impurities, and extremely low uranium and thorium content of less than 0.001%. Overall recoveries of the most in-demand magnet rare earths, neodymium and praseodymium, reached around 75% for OD6.\n\nThe high value magnet rare earths account for 23% of the TREO grade at Splinter Rock, which hosts a resource so far of 682 million tonnes @ 1,338 parts per million for 910,000 tonnes of contained TREO. The magnet rare earths provide about 205,000 tonnes of the contained resource.\n\nMining.com.au Editor-in-Chief Adam Orlando has more than 20 years’ experience in the media having held senior roles at various publications, including as Asia-Pacific Sector Head (Mining) at global newswire Acuris (formerly Mergermarket).

Cash balances rose to an average of $11.02 million, the first lift in a year.\",0.9\nrare earth,The Rare Earth Metal Driving Tensions Between the US and China - WIRED,https://www.wired.com/story/yttrium-rare-earth-metal-china-us/,\"Yttrium plays a critical role in everything from aircraft engines to semiconductors. China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing anytime soon.\n\nThe alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have [promised a truce over rare earth minerals]( the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.\n\nAlthough a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the [Chinese export restrictions]( introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.\n\nBut other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.\n\nYttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.\n\nThe problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.\n\nWhen Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty about delivery times. In the rare earths trade, lack of predictability is often more damaging than reduced volumes: An industry accustomed to just-in-time deliveries can be thrown into crisis by even a few weeks of delay.\n\nThe effects were immediate. In Europe, yttrium oxide prices have soared, reaching a 4,400 percent increase since the beginning of the year. Aerospace companies, which rely heavily on this material, have expressed alarm and demanded urgent measures from the US government to expand domestic production. The semiconductor industry is no less concerned: Some companies have called the situation a “serious” threat, predicting impacts on costs, efficiency, and production timelines. Gas-fired power plants, which use yttrium in the protective coatings of turbines, are also monitoring Chinese developments with increasing attention, although they maintain that they have not yet experienced disruptions.\n\nThe situation in warehouses outside China adds further layers of complexity. Available reserves, according to piecemeal estimates, range from one to 12 months, depending on the producers. Some traders have already reported running out of material; from quantities in the hundreds of tons range, many are down to just a few units. Others are completely out of stock. This volatility makes the market extremely fragile and underscores how the global supply chain depends on a small number of players.\n\nChinese exports to several countries have fallen by about 30 percent. China, which aims to become an autonomous tech powerhouse, therefore maintains a position of strength and a high degree of discretion, carefully regulating the quantities released to the international market. Moreover, the measures introduced by Beijing in the sector from the outset are flexible enough to allow it to modulate the flow of shipments according to political priorities.\n\nOn the political front, the trade truce between Washington and Beijing has yet to produce concrete results. The two sides have given negotiators until the end of November to outline clearer terms for rare earth exports to the United States, but the gap between their respective priorities remains wide. Beijing continues to work on a licensing system, inspired by mechanisms already used by the United States, that would allow for faster flow only to companies deemed to have no ties to the US military industry. This would leave many Western companies operating in the delicate boundary between civilian production and defense applications at a disadvantage, further complicating access to materials.\n\nChina's strategy involves not only controlling trade flows, but also managing technical expertise internationally. Authorities have begun requiring detailed lists of technicians specializing in rare earths, restricting their travel abroad and monitoring potential transfers of expertise to rival countries. At the same time, bans on the export of advanced rare earth processing technologies continue, a sector in which China holds a leadership position that is unlikely to be replicated in the short term. This dual approach—control of physical resources and human capital—strengthens Chinese primacy and hampers attempts to build an alternative supply chain.\n\nThe United States is nevertheless trying to fight back. New industrial projects, such as that of ReElement Technologies in Indiana, aim to produce yttrium oxide domestically starting in December, with an initial capacity of 200 tons per year, set to double within a few months. While this figure isn't enough to cover total US needs, it represents a first step toward diversification.\n\nDuring Trump's recent visit to Asia, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to jointly exploit the giant Minamitori undersea deposit, discovered years ago in the Pacific seabed. Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of a joint study to develop technologies and infrastructure capable of extracting these strategic materials from extreme ocean depths, a feat that will require enormous investment and advanced technical cooperation.\n\nYet the absence of a complete supply chain—from extraction to refining—makes the transition slow and complex. China has no intention of giving up its dominant position, a crucial and potentially decisive negotiating lever.\n\nTopics[China](/tag/china/)[manufacturing](/tag/manufacturing/)[materials](/tag/materials/)[Metal](/tag/metal/)[trade](/tag/trade/)\n\n*The Fantastic Four: First Steps*, *Thunderbolts\\**, and *Something Wicked This Way Comes* are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nGet 10% off your first order at Western Digital when you register your email.\n\nEnjoy up to 50% off deliveries, free meals, and more with the latest Home Chef coupons.\n\nYou can snag a discount on all the Pixel 10 phone varieties if you act fast.\n\nThis $400 set comes with minifigures of the complete Next Gen crew, including Picard, Riker, and Wesley Crusher’s portable tractor beam.\n\nSave hundreds on our preferred MacBook for most people.\n\nAll-Clad cookware is the best you can buy—and it has a price tag to match.

Notably, the sides agreed on enhanced pension system cooperation and signed a memorandum to advance veterinary services and agricultural research.\n\nKazakhstan’s National Academy of Sciences and Turkmenistan’s Academy of Sciences also agreed to increase research collaboration.\n\nAccording to [The Times of Central Asia]( Kazakhstan, long recognized for its substantial rare earth metals reserves, is moving beyond the familiar characterization of “underutilized potential” and is taking on a more active role in global critical material supply chains. The state-owned mining company Tau-Ken Samruk has become a key driver of this shift, expanding both at home and abroad.\n\nKazakhstan recently confirmed a new deposit with major reserves of cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and yttrium, strengthening its position as one of the few countries producing more than half of the known rare earth elements. The national strategy now centers on developing a full industrial cycle rather than exporting raw materials.\n\nA clear example of this change came in 2025, when Tau-Ken Samruk signed an agreement with U.S. based Cove Capital to develop the Severny Katpar and Verkhniy Kairakty tungsten deposits. A similar project with China’s Xiamen Tungsten collapsed in 2018 without binding commitments, highlighting growing geopolitical competition around Kazakhstan’s resources.\n\nThe country is also expanding internationally. According to Samruk-Kazyna chairman Nurlan Zhakupov, Kazakhstan aims to process materials from both domestic and foreign sources. “Tau-Ken Samruk is actively engaging with foreign partners,” he said, noting exploration projects underway in Rwanda and Afghanistan.\n\nThese efforts illustrate Kazakhstan’s ambition to secure a larger role in global supply chains. Despite political and security risks abroad, the country continues to pursue long-term partnerships and deeper integration into the rare earth market.\n\nWomen in Kazakhstan are reshaping the tech landscape, entering the sector from diverse backgrounds and driving new forms of innovation, [Euronews]( reports.\n\nA key figure in this movement is Assem Bolatzhan, who shifted from finance to IT in 2015 through the Digital Kazakhstan program.\n\n“We launched the Women in Tech chapter in Kazakhstan because we need to be part of a global community,” she says.\n\nAccording to Women in Tech Astana lead Rinata Ilyubayeva, nearly 60% of women-led startups focus on social impact.\n\n“Most female startups are in EdTech, HealthTech, and solutions for children with autism, elderly people, and pregnant women,” she notes.\n\nThe momentum has led to the creation of Central Asia’s first female-focused venture capital initiative.\n\n“We are building a platform to support women, because it’s not always easy,” says Ilyubayeva.\n\nEntrepreneurs like Aigerim Nurgaliyeva show how women without technical training can succeed.\n\n“The first obstacle was in my mind,” she says. “You can build a startup without coding.”\n\nSCAT Airlines (DV, Shymkent) is considering adding either B777 or B787 aircraft to its fleet for deliveries after 2030, Aviation Week has reported, citing senior marketing manager Zhanar Balgabay.\n\nAccording to [ch-aviation]( data, the Kazakh airline currently has commitments for seven more B737-8s and one additional B737-9.\n\nIts in-house fleet comprises one B737-300, three B737-500s, one B737-700, seven B737-8s, eight B737-800s, five B737-9s, two CRJ200ERs, and two CRJ200LRs.\n\nIn addition, three B757-200s and one B767-300ER are operated by subsidiary Sunday Airlines (Shymkent), which deploys the aircraft on charter services to destinations including Phuket, Dhaka, Moscow Vnukovo, Phu Quoc, and Nha Trang Cam Ranh.\n\nMeanwhile, SCAT Airlines has firmed plans to launch flights from Turkistan to Urgench, Bukhara, and Samarkand by December 2025.

On the first day we’re diving into one gift that set the tone of the year for critical minerals explorer [Iltani Resources]( (ASX:ILT).\n\nSince June 2023, the company has focused exploration efforts at the Orient deposit near Herberton in Far North Queensland, uncovering its prospectivity to produce silver, lead, zinc, and indium.\n\nEarlier this year, Iltani’s efforts paid off when the company flagged the asset to potentially be one of the *“highest-grade known silver-indium”* deposits, emerging as one of 2025’s brightest lights in critical minerals exploration, as [reported]( by *Mining.com.au*.\n\nThe project comprises two main areas of focus – Orient East and Orient West – within the greater Herberton Project, which spans around 367km2 in the Herberton Mineral Field.\n\nThe combined deposits have returned a maiden resource estimate of 62.5 million tonnes @ 81.5 grams per tonne silver-equivalent at a 30g/t cut-off grade, with a higher grade core of 34.2 million tonnes @ 110.4g/t silver-equivalent with a 60g/t cut-off grade – the kind worth placing under any explorer’s Christmas tree.\n\nOrient East hosts a resource of 19.8 million tonnes @ 98g/t silver-equivalent, with a higher grade core of 12.6 million tonnes @ 128g/t silver-equivalent, as [reported](\n\nOn the return of recent versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) target drilling at the project, Iltani says Orient has demonstrated potential to materially increase the mineral resource.\n\n*Mining.com.au* [reports]( across a 10-hole shallow campaign, the first hole (ORR128) delivered multiple intersections of *“thick”* silver-lead-zinc-indium mineralisation, 450m north of the Orient East resource zone.\n\nMineralisation remains open along strike and down-dip, which is believed to upgrade the resource substantially.\n\nIltani has received its final assay results from VTEM drilling, such as 20m @ 93.8 grams per tonne silver-equivalent (AgEq) from 4m, including 6m @ 132g/t AgEq from 18m; 3m @ 130.9g/t AgEq from 170m, including 1m @ 279.3g/t AgEq from 171m.\n\nThe company is now conducting a surface electromagnetic (EM) survey at the Orient to target deeper anomalies generated by VTEM drilling, as [reported](\n\nSpeaking to *Mining.com.au* on the sidelines of the [Noosa Mining Investor Conference]( Iltani Managing Director Donald Garner says the main revenue drivers for the project are silver, then followed by zinc, lead, and indium in that order.\n\n*“As long as gold sees high, silver will see high,”* Garner tells this news service.\n\nAs the festive season approaches, silver has been enjoying its own holiday cheer, marked at US$49.99 per ounce as of 24 November 2025, indicating a 73.12% for the commodity’s value from this year to date [according]( to Trading Economics.\n\nZinc on the other hand is priced at US$3,010, almost at a 1% increase for this year-to-date.\n\n*“Zinc recently almost touched a dollar fifty a pound, which is really good to see. The Zinc TCs treatment charges are low, which is also good,”* Garner adds.\n\n*“If we are successful with the permitting and development process, we’ll be in production in three or four years’ time.”*\n\nAt the same conference, Garner describes sentiment to be high ahead of the year’s end for miners across different commodities.\n\n*“There’s a resurgence in commodity prices, gold sales in particular, but the base metals are doing well and you’ve got this increasing interest in critical minerals,”* Garner mentions.\n\n*“They want to see mining in the state. They want to see value created in the state, jobs, revenues – it’s a really good time to be working in Queensland.”*\n\nIltani is [receiving]( an $8 million investment from the Queensland Investment Corporation’s (QIC) Critical Minerals and Battery Technology Fund (QCMBTF) to further develop the Orient Project.\n\nThe total grant comprises $6 million in cash in exchange for a 2% royalty on future product sales from the greater Herberton Project if commercial production begins by the end of 2030, otherwise boosting to 2.5%, as well as $2 million cash for the issue of 5.41 million shares.\n\nShares will be issued at $0.37 each, indicating a 10% discount to the 20-day volume weighted average price prior to the agreement.\n\n*“Now with the funding from the QIC, we’ll build on what we’ve got and do more,”* Garner adds.\n\nThe QIC is a state government-owned corporation that manages the QCMBTF to bolster businesses focused on supporting Queensland’s critical minerals supply chain, holding $131.6 billion worth of assets under management as of 30 June 2025.\n\nGarner explains that while the Iltani’s main priority is exploring the Orient Project, the company is always looking for opportunities to *“create value for shareholders”.*\n\n*“If we don’t look, we won’t find and you’ll never know when we’ll come across one of those,”* Garner says.\n\n*“We’re growing the team at Orient to make sure we deliver the best possible project for our shareholders and for Queensland.”*\n\nThe company will focus on drill targets inside the Caldera Complex including the Boonmoo gold and Union Jack base metal targets, before mapping the Orient and Antimony Reward projects.\n\n*“Once we understand the controls of the mineralisation, we might go back to Antimony Reward but our main focus is at Orient,”* Garner tells [*Mining.com.au*](\n\nThe Antimony Reward deposit sits roughly 17km from Orient, also within the Herberton Project in Queensland.\n\nIltani completed initial drilling at the asset in 2024, with assays [returning]( 7m @ 7.61% antimony from 38m, including 3m @ 8.19% from 38m and 1m @ 26.70% from 43m in hole ARRC001.\n\nHole ARRC003 intersected 3m @ 0.75% antimony from 31m, including 1m @ 1.25% from 32m; and 4m @ 0.43%, including 1m @ 1.28% from 42m, while hole ARRC004 intersected 9m @ 0.94% from 53m, including 2m @ 2.66% from 60m.\n\nIltani Resources is a mineral explorer focused on the discovery and development of critical minerals for a clean energy future.\n\nAs day one of *Mining.com.au*’s 12 days of Christmas series comes to a close, Iltani’s discovery highs in 2025 sets the tone for the next year and the next door on our advent calendar.\n\nMaddison is a recent journalism and business graduate with a passion for crafting impactful stories.

They're not hard to find if you know where to look. Such stocks with [multibagger]( potential are often hidden among leaders in fast-growing industries, first movers in industries with exponential potential, and innovative start-ups that are shaping the future.\n\nTwo such stocks have caught my attention. Each has such compelling growth prospects that buying them now and holding them could yield monster returns over the next five years or so.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRare-earth elements technically aren't rare, but it's not easy to extract them in ways that are economically viable. China has a monopoly, accounting for almost 70% of the global rare-earth extraction. That also means [80% of the rare-earth elements consumed in the U.S.]( are imported, with nearly all of them coming from China.\n\nThat's not a great place to be. Rare-earth elements are vital for electronics, semiconductors, robotics, [defense]( and aerospace technologies, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and more. However, China's dominance poses significant supply risks to the U.S. Additionally, it has always disincentivized U.S. [mining]( companies from pouring money into rare-earth elements. President Donald Trump wants to change that and, therefore, has allocated billions of dollars to critical mineral projects, even buying stakes in some domestic producers to secure U.S. supply chains.\n\nThere is only one active rare-earth mine in the U.S.: the Mountain Pass in California, owned and operated by **MP Materials** ([MP](/quote/nyse/mp/) +2.99%).\n\nIn July 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense, rebranded as the Department of War (DOW) by Trump, acquired a 15% stake in MP Materials and became its largest shareholder. MP Materials will build a rare-earth magnet manufacturing facility, known as the 10X facility, with the DOW committing to purchase 100% of the rare-earth magnets produced at the facility for 10 years. Two of its other major deals include:\n\n* A $500 million multiyear agreement with tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](/quote/nasdaq/aapl/) +0.46%) to supply magnets.\n\n* A partnership with the DOW and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to develop a rare-earth refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nMP Materials currently produces rare-earth oxides and metals and will begin production of magnets by the end of 2025. [MP Materials stock already carries a market cap of $10 billion]( but that could look minuscule five years from now.\n\nShares of **Symbotic** ([SYM](/quote/nasdaq/sym/) 4.04%) have surged over 250% so far in 2025, as of this writing. And there could be a lot more to come.\n\nSymbotic automates warehouses and distribution centers with [artificial intelligence (AI)]( [robotics]( that can move, store, and sort items. Symbotic went public in 2022 but has been working with **Walmart** ([WMT](/quote/nyse/wmt/) +1.31%) since 2015 to deploy robotic systems at multiple distribution centers. In January 2025, Symbotic acquired Walmart's advanced systems and robotics (ASR) business for automated fulfillment of orders, a new product category for Symbotic.\n\nUnder yet another new and recent agreement, Symbotic will develop and install automated micro-fulfillment systems for online pickup and delivery at Walmart's retail stores. Symbotic expects its first prototype to be ready in 2026. Meanwhile, Symbotic is developing a next-generation storage technology as well. Besides Walmart, Symbotic's other customers include **Albertsons**, C&S Wholesale Grocers, GreenBox, and **Target**.\n\nSymbotic has also just announced something big: It has signed up Medline as a customer, marking its foray into healthcare. [Medline is a major distributor of medical supplies]( in the U.S. and is expected to go public soon. Symbotic deployed its first system to Medline last quarter.\n\nSymbotic's entry into healthcare marks a significant milestone, as it opens up a new vertical for the company beyond retail and could fast-track its sales growth. Symbotic just posted a 26% growth in revenue for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 27, 2025, and projects similar growth for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.\n\nMost importantly, Symbotic ended the year with a backlog of $22.5 billion. That's huge, as it represents nearly a decade's worth of sales. So, even though Symbotic's market cap has surpassed $50 billion, its estimated addressable market runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars, making it a solid stock to own for the long term.\n\nBoth MP Materials and Symbotic share a common link -- they have the first-mover advantage in their respective industries, *and* both industries have exponential growth potential. That's what makes these stocks so appealing. Growth stocks carry their share of risks, but with both Symbotic and MP Materials already generating revenue and striking significant partnerships, they're worth the risk.\n\nNeha Chamaria is a contributing Motley Fool stock market analyst covering energy, industrials, utilities, and materials sectors, with a focus on dividend stocks.

so we will need to wait for final assays from these holes (due in mid-December).*\n\n**BPM** released an update on [**its rare earth project**](/quick-takes/bpm-samples-rare-earth-oxide-grades-up-to-965-in-wa/) in WA.\n\n*Rock chips grading up to 9.65% TREO, within a newly confirmed 5km of mineralised strike... but most importantly, the same type of rocks that Iluka is looking to feed through its WA refinery that is under construction.*\n\nThe bigger news from **BPM** this week was that it [**raised $3.5M to help expand and accelerate drilling**](/quick-takes/bpm-raises-funds-drilling-on-wa-gold-asset-to-start-in-few-days/) at its WA gold project (*which should start in the coming weeks*).\n\n**ILA** was [**added to the Medical Countermeasures Coalition**](/quick-takes/ila-added-to-a-coalition-of-companies-which-includes-multi-billion-dollar-big-pharma-companies/) (MC2) to advance US procurement and stockpiling opportunities.\n\n*Some interesting names make up that coalition, including a few who have a proven track record developing drugs that went onto get big US stockpiling deals.*\n\n**PNN** announced [**results from a drill program**](/quick-takes/pnn-now-weeks-away-from-10000m-drill-program-on-brazilian-rare-earths-asset/) on its Brazilian rare earth project.\n\n*The results were from a shallow auger program, and delivered further high grade niobium and rare earths results...*\n\n*Next PNN will kick off the first phase of a 10,000m RC drill program (due to start in December) ahead of a “maiden resource in Q1-2026”.*\n\n**SGQ** hit [**extensions to its already large rare earths resource**](/quick-takes/sgq-hits-extensions-to-the-biggest-rare-earths-resources-deposit-in-south-america/) in Brazil.\n\n*SGQ has 3 rigs drilling 24/7, 29 assays in the lab and 40 more holes planned... so we should see more good news like this week’s results over the coming weeks/months.*\n\n**KAU** is looking at ways [**to get more feed**](/quick-takes/kau-to-drill-waste-dumps-next-to-victorian-processing-plant/) through its processing plant in Victoria...\n\n*One of those had samples with grades of 0.86g/t, the other 1.8g/t... both very processable grades especially so close to KAU’s Victorian plant and an all time high gold price.*\n\n**ION** raised $4.4M to “*Advance E-Waste Recycling Opportunities in the USA*”.\n\n*We participated in ION’s capital raise -

Heart Failure.**\n\nHeart Failure is one of the big heart diseases - US$60BN is spent on it, 1 in 4 Americans will get it, and it's the leading cause of rehospitalisation.\n\nEIQ’s clinical validation study was run by the prestigious Mayo Clinic. The study delivered exceptional results on **detecting heart failure with 99.5% sensitivity and 91.0% specificity** ([source](\n\nMuch better than the only other AI heart failure detection software used in the market today which delivers **sensitivity of 87.8% and specificity of 81.9%** ([source](\n\n(Both technologies are a step change from current practices where only 50% of Heart Failure cases are accurately diagnosed.)\n\nIF EIQ can get FDA approval for its Heart Failure AI model, there already exists a reimbursement code the company can use to commercialise its AI tech.\n\nThe reimbursement code exists thanks to Ultromics (who [raised US$55M]( in a series C funding round valuing them at US$300M / A$464M back in July).\n\nNow we watch for FDA clearance...\n\n**IIQ** is developing an exosome platform technology.\n\nIIQ is applying its exosome platform to develop diagnostics (detecting diseases) AND therapeutics (treating diseases).\n\nExosomes are tiny, microscopic extra-cellular “containers” that carry ‘messages’ between the human body's cells that allows the human body to function.\n\n**IIQ is going after two types of cancer that have NO approved/recommended treatments or diagnostic tools.**\n\n* Ovarian cancer is usually asymptomatic (no symptoms) in the early stages of the disease. If a woman is diagnosed at stage 1 - the survival rates can be over 90%. If a woman is diagnosed at stages 3/4 survival rates can be ~29%. ~70% of all ovarian cancer in Australia is diagnosed as advanced [stage 3 or 4 cancer](\n\n* At the moment there are no recommended screening tests for women who show no symptoms of ovarian cancer - meaning there is no quick and easy screening test that can be regularly taken by all healthy women to catch ovarian cancer early.\n\n* **IIQ’s screening test has been able to detect all stage 1 and 2 ovarian cancers (the earliest but asymptomatic stages where survival rates are the highest), with over 99.6% specificity (catching 99.6% of all patients with cancer) AND NO misdiagnosis.**\n\n* **What’s Next:** IIQ to do a larger clinical validation study (to see if the test works on a larger cohort of patients) then look at “strategic partnering” to commercialise the screening tool.\n\n* Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of breast cancer that does NOT respond to traditional breast cancer therapies.\n\n* At the moment, there are no approved cell therapies treating triple negative breast cancer.\n\n* IIQ is developing the therapeutic under a deal signed with the prestigious Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Peter Mac) in Melbourne. The institution is among only a handful globally that combines a dedicated cancer hospital with a fully integrated cancer research program.\n\n* **So far IIQ has shown that its therapeutic was able to kill more than 90% of the cancer cells within 10 hours of treatment in in vitro studies (in a laboratory setting).**\n\n* **What’s next:** Next for the therapeutic is the results from animal studies (in-vivo) due this quarter.\n\nWe think that any solid tumour therapeutic IIQ is able to develop could be a game changer for the company.\n\nMainly because it would de-risk IIQ’s platform tech (if it works for one cancer, why wouldn't it work for others?)...\n\nWe called **BKB** our 2025 Next Investors Small Cap Pick of the Year because it acquired 100% of a previously producing, high grade silver project, in Texas, USA.\n\nWhile it sits in Texas USA, geologically, it actually sits on Mexico’s famous Sierra Madre belt, which is home to some of the world’s biggest silver producers.\n\n**We want to see BKB get this project back into production as quickly as possible, while silver prices are at all time highs** (we think the silver price could go on a generational run over the coming years and have positioned our Portfolio for this scenario).\n\nAND in the nearer term, we want to see the BKB team execute on their plan to restart their silver mine and processing plant in Texas while drilling out to grow their in ground silver resource.\n\nThis week BKB announced high grade rock chips OUTSIDE of the existing silver resource (grades up to 3,100 g/t silver):\n\nSilver gapped up almost 10% this week so all eyes on the open for this one tomorrow.\n\n**EXR** is the biggest net acreage holder in the Taroom Trough - second only to supermajor $320BN Shell.\n\nEXR just did a deal with the #3 landholder in the region - Omega Oil and Gas.\n\nOmega took a 19.43% position in EXR in exchange for $13.9M at 4.1c per share.\n\nOmega is backed by Tri-Star (pioneers of the Queensland gas industry) and it recently did a deal with ~$2.8BN Beach Energy.\n\nAfter all is said and done EXR will have a $35.3M capital budget to work with.\n\nAND next, EXR is drilling a vertical well targeting a ~1 trillion cubic feet of contingent gas resource (estimate).\n\nDrilling starts in January...\n\nAnd then a horizontal section, with stimulating and testing will follow straight after.\n\nIt all kicks off on the 12th of January according to the EXR MD and CEO Stuart Nicholls in a webinar a few days ago. ([Source - watch it here](\n\nWe also noticed that were two specific conditions as part of Omega’s investment in EXR.\n\nFirst the “standstill” - which means Omega can’t buy any more shares in EXR for at least 12 months - basically EXR is given a 12-month period to deliver material catalysts (like the Lorelle drilling and horizontal well)...\n\nAnd second, the support condition - which basically means if EXR were to attract a takeover offer within the next 12 months from someone OTHER THAN Omega, Omega wouldn't be able to block the transaction (UNLESS they are willing to match/beat the proposal).\n\nWe think this is a very good deal for EXR shareholders, especially if the January drill results come in...\n\n**After this week’s deal, the clear front runners in the Taroom Trough are EXR/Omega and then $320BN Shell...**\n\n**Bloomberg -** While stablecoins are set on revolutionising payments, [**200-year-old lessons from America's free-banking era**]( could determine whether they survive real-world financial stress.\n\n**Bloomberg -** Global silver market tightens as [**China’s stockpiles plummet to decade-low**]( record exports surge, and near-term prices climb in backwardation.\n\n**Bloomberg -** Beijing [**mixes trade power and diplomacy at G-20**]( curbing rare earth exports while rolling out a new international mining initiative.\n\n**Mining.com -** [**US backs Brazil’s Serra Verde**]( with $465M funding to boost rare earth production, cutting Western reliance on China for critical minerals.\n\nThat isn't the first time US capital has made its way into Brazilian rare earths space... good news for our Investment in Brazil [**SGQ**](/company/asx-sgq/).\n\n**Bloomberg -** UK unveils plan to produce 10% of critical minerals domestically and [**recycle 20% by 2035**]( with £50M backing local industry.\n\n*Our Investment* [***ION***](/company/asx-ion/) *is currently getting its foot in the door in the US and has already taken early steps toward doing the same in Europe...*\n\n**Reuters -** EXIM announces [**$100BN investment to stabilize US and allied critical minerals**]( nuclear, and LNG supply chains amid global shortages.\n\n**The Telegraph -** A [**Marburg virus outbreak in Ethiopia**]( has already killed five and is spreading fast near Kenyan and South Sudan’s borders, experts warn of high fatality risk.\n\n*A terrible disease that we hope one day our Investment ILA’s Marburg drug can help tackle:* [***ILA: Our Biotech Pick of the Year***](/articles/ila-our-biotech-pick-of-the-year/)\n\n[***Mithril Silver and Gold (ASX: MTH) - Updated Resource for Silver Gold Project in Mexico Coming in Q1 2026***](\n\n[***Echo IQ (ASX: EIQ) - Investor Briefing: Exceptional Results for EchoSolv HF Validation Study***](\n\n[***One of America’s Biggest Gold Wholesalers Exposes the Most Common Gold Scam Enslaving the Country***](\n\n[**Locksley Resources (ASX: LKY | OTCQX: LKYRF) CEO Kerrie Matthews was on site and getting amongst the flurry of activity underway at its Mojave project in California**](\n\n## A word of caution...\n\nWhile we aim to highlight developments in the small cap space, investing in early-stage and small cap companies - like those we cover - is inherently risky.\n\nThese companies often face funding challenges, regulatory hurdles, and market volatility.

China has a monopoly, accounting for almost 70% of the global rare-earth extraction. That also means [80% of the rare-earth elements consumed in the U.S.]( are imported, with nearly all of them coming from China.\n\nThat's not a great place to be. Rare-earth elements are vital for electronics, semiconductors, robotics, [defense]( and aerospace technologies, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and more. However, China's dominance poses significant supply risks to the U.S. Additionally, it has always disincentivized U.S. [mining]( companies from pouring money into rare-earth elements. President Donald Trump wants to change that and, therefore, has allocated billions of dollars to critical mineral projects, even buying stakes in some domestic producers to secure U.S. supply chains.\n\nThere is only one active rare-earth mine in the U.S.: the Mountain Pass in California, owned and operated by **MP Materials** ([MP](/quote/nyse/mp/) +2.99%).\n\nIn July 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense, rebranded as the Department of War (DOW) by Trump, acquired a 15% stake in MP Materials and became its largest shareholder. MP Materials will build a rare-earth magnet manufacturing facility, known as the 10X facility, with the DOW committing to purchase 100% of the rare-earth magnets produced at the facility for 10 years. Two of its other major deals include:\n\n* A $500 million multiyear agreement with tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](/quote/nasdaq/aapl/) +0.46%) to supply magnets.\n\n* A partnership with the DOW and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to develop a rare-earth refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nMP Materials currently produces rare-earth oxides and metals and will begin production of magnets by the end of 2025. [MP Materials stock already carries a market cap of $10 billion]( but that could look minuscule five years from now.\n\nShares of **Symbotic** ([SYM](/quote/nasdaq/sym/) 4.04%) have surged over 250% so far in 2025, as of this writing. And there could be a lot more to come.\n\nSymbotic automates warehouses and distribution centers with [artificial intelligence (AI)]( [robotics]( that can move, store, and sort items. Symbotic went public in 2022 but has been working with **Walmart** ([WMT](/quote/nyse/wmt/) +1.31%) since 2015 to deploy robotic systems at multiple distribution centers. In January 2025, Symbotic acquired Walmart's advanced systems and robotics (ASR) business for automated fulfillment of orders, a new product category for Symbotic.\n\nUnder yet another new and recent agreement, Symbotic will develop and install automated micro-fulfillment systems for online pickup and delivery at Walmart's retail stores. Symbotic expects its first prototype to be ready in 2026. Meanwhile, Symbotic is developing a next-generation storage technology as well. Besides Walmart, Symbotic's other customers include **Albertsons**, C&S Wholesale Grocers, GreenBox, and **Target**.\n\nSymbotic has also just announced something big: It has signed up Medline as a customer, marking its foray into healthcare. [Medline is a major distributor of medical supplies]( in the U.S. and is expected to go public soon. Symbotic deployed its first system to Medline last quarter.\n\nSymbotic's entry into healthcare marks a significant milestone, as it opens up a new vertical for the company beyond retail and could fast-track its sales growth. Symbotic just posted a 26% growth in revenue for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 27, 2025, and projects similar growth for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.\n\nMost importantly, Symbotic ended the year with a backlog of $22.5 billion. That's huge, as it represents nearly a decade's worth of sales. So, even though Symbotic's market cap has surpassed $50 billion, its estimated addressable market runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars, making it a solid stock to own for the long term.\n\nBoth MP Materials and Symbotic share a common link -- they have the first-mover advantage in their respective industries, *and* both industries have exponential growth potential. That's what makes these stocks so appealing. Growth stocks carry their share of risks, but with both Symbotic and MP Materials already generating revenue and striking significant partnerships, they're worth the risk.\n\nNeha Chamaria is a contributing Motley Fool stock market analyst covering energy, industrials, utilities, and materials sectors, with a focus on dividend stocks.

China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing anytime soon.\n\nThe alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have [promised a truce over rare earth minerals]( the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.\n\nAlthough a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the [Chinese export restrictions]( introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.\n\nBut other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.\n\nYttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.\n\nThe problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.\n\nWhen Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty about delivery times. In the rare earths trade, lack of predictability is often more damaging than reduced volumes: An industry accustomed to just-in-time deliveries can be thrown into crisis by even a few weeks of delay.\n\nThe effects were immediate. In Europe, yttrium oxide prices have soared, reaching a 4,400 percent increase since the beginning of the year. Aerospace companies, which rely heavily on this material, have expressed alarm and demanded urgent measures from the US government to expand domestic production. The semiconductor industry is no less concerned: Some companies have called the situation a “serious” threat, predicting impacts on costs, efficiency, and production timelines. Gas-fired power plants, which use yttrium in the protective coatings of turbines, are also monitoring Chinese developments with increasing attention, although they maintain that they have not yet experienced disruptions.\n\nThe situation in warehouses outside China adds further layers of complexity. Available reserves, according to piecemeal estimates, range from one to 12 months, depending on the producers. Some traders have already reported running out of material; from quantities in the hundreds of tons range, many are down to just a few units. Others are completely out of stock. This volatility makes the market extremely fragile and underscores how the global supply chain depends on a small number of players.\n\nChinese exports to several countries have fallen by about 30 percent. China, which aims to become an autonomous tech powerhouse, therefore maintains a position of strength and a high degree of discretion, carefully regulating the quantities released to the international market. Moreover, the measures introduced by Beijing in the sector from the outset are flexible enough to allow it to modulate the flow of shipments according to political priorities.\n\nOn the political front, the trade truce between Washington and Beijing has yet to produce concrete results. The two sides have given negotiators until the end of November to outline clearer terms for rare earth exports to the United States, but the gap between their respective priorities remains wide. Beijing continues to work on a licensing system, inspired by mechanisms already used by the United States, that would allow for faster flow only to companies deemed to have no ties to the US military industry. This would leave many Western companies operating in the delicate boundary between civilian production and defense applications at a disadvantage, further complicating access to materials.\n\nChina's strategy involves not only controlling trade flows, but also managing technical expertise internationally. Authorities have begun requiring detailed lists of technicians specializing in rare earths, restricting their travel abroad and monitoring potential transfers of expertise to rival countries. At the same time, bans on the export of advanced rare earth processing technologies continue, a sector in which China holds a leadership position that is unlikely to be replicated in the short term. This dual approach—control of physical resources and human capital—strengthens Chinese primacy and hampers attempts to build an alternative supply chain.\n\nThe United States is nevertheless trying to fight back. New industrial projects, such as that of ReElement Technologies in Indiana, aim to produce yttrium oxide domestically starting in December, with an initial capacity of 200 tons per year, set to double within a few months. While this figure isn't enough to cover total US needs, it represents a first step toward diversification.\n\nDuring Trump's recent visit to Asia, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to jointly exploit the giant Minamitori undersea deposit, discovered years ago in the Pacific seabed. Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of a joint study to develop technologies and infrastructure capable of extracting these strategic materials from extreme ocean depths, a feat that will require enormous investment and advanced technical cooperation.\n\nYet the absence of a complete supply chain—from extraction to refining—makes the transition slow and complex. China has no intention of giving up its dominant position, a crucial and potentially decisive negotiating lever.\n\nTopics[China](/tag/china/)[manufacturing](/tag/manufacturing/)[materials](/tag/materials/)[Metal](/tag/metal/)[trade](/tag/trade/)\n\n*The Fantastic Four: First Steps*, *Thunderbolts\\**, and *Something Wicked This Way Comes* are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nGet 10% off your first order at Western Digital when you register your email.\n\nEnjoy up to 50% off deliveries, free meals, and more with the latest Home Chef coupons.\n\nYou can snag a discount on all the Pixel 10 phone varieties if you act fast.\n\nThis $400 set comes with minifigures of the complete Next Gen crew, including Picard, Riker, and Wesley Crusher’s portable tractor beam.\n\nSave hundreds on our preferred MacBook for most people.\n\nAll-Clad cookware is the best you can buy—and it has a price tag to match.

[Yttrium]( (Y), [terbium]( (Tb), [erbium]( (Er), and [ytterbium]( (Yb) are all named after the village.\n\nOther elements including holmium, gadolinium, scandium, tantalum, and thulium were first discovered there, making Ytterby the richest source of naturally occurring elements on Earth.\n\nBack in 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius discovered a strange, unusually heavy black ore in an old quarry near Ytterby. This new ore was named by Arrhenius as ytterbite.\n\nTwo years later, a Finnish chemist identified from Arrhenius’ initial sample the first rare earth element – named yttrium. In just over 50 years following Arrhenius’ original discovery, Carl Gustav Mosander found that ytterbite was actually a mixture of three metal oxides, and a fourth was later discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac from the original sample.\n\nEventually as refining techniques improved, more new elements were discovered and ultimately over the next 100 years since Arrhenius’ discovery, nine more elements fell out of this strange, unusually heavy black ore.\n\nAmong these hard-to-pronounce elements is yttrium – a soft, grey-white metal that is fairly stable in air but reacts with water, acids, and bases.\n\nIt occurs in other ‘rare earth’ minerals, monazite and bastnaesite, though xenotime, which is mined in China and Malaysia, can contain up to 50% yttrium phosphate, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nYttrium metal is produced by reducing yttrium fluoride with calcium metal and is often used as an additive in alloys for its strengthening properties. When alloyed with aluminum, magnesium, and chromium, it acts to strengthen those metals.\n\nIn addition to its applications in speciality alloys found in engines, yttrium is used in coatings to shield against high temperatures.\n\nYttrium oxide is added to glass used to produce camera lenses as it makes them heat and shock resistant. It’s found in white LED lights as well as superconductors and lasers, with yttrium oxysulfide widely sought to produce red phosphors for old-style colour television tubes.\n\nLasers that can cut through metals require yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG), marking yet another of its many applications in everyday life.\n\nWhile its origins may come from Sweden, like other rare earths and critical minerals, China dominates global production and supply of yttrium. China supplies the US 93% of its yttrium imports, creating acute vulnerability across Western supply chains.\n\nThe world’s supplies are now running low due to Chinese export restrictions, sparking fears of looming protracted shortages, and rocketing costs that could hit every sector from aerospace, to energy and semiconductor production.\n\nOn the back of China restricting yttrium exports (along with six other rare earths in April in retaliation to the US tariffs) yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) prices have been soaring more than 4,000% in Europe in 2025.\n\nRecently, prices surpassed US$275/kg, as China’s tightening export controls disrupt global supply chains for military and defence, aerospace, semiconductors, and advanced materials. These shortages are also affecting markets related to high-temperature alloys, laser systems, avionics, and defence components.\n\nMagnet rare earth prices also remain high, with Benchmark reporting Dy oxide (DDP China) at over US$200/kg and Tb oxide (DDP China) at almost US$1,000/kg.\n\n[Victory Metals]( (ASX:VTM) CEO Brendan Clark says this global backdrop highlights the company’s strategic positioning as a major future yttrium supplier with what’s emerging as a valuable heavy rare earth basket.\n\nThe company’s current mineral resource hosts over 35 million kilograms of Y₂O₃ with forecast production targets over 600 tonnes annually tonnes along with strategic critical minerals dysprosium, terbium, neodymium and praseodymium, gallium, hafnium, and scandium.\n\nClark says yttrium is emerging as one of the world’s most important critical minerals and this global supply crunch is happening much faster than anyone expected.\n\n*“Our North Stanmore deposit continues to demonstrate the scale, grade, and mineralogy required to supply Western nations with secure, long-term yttrium supply,”* the CEO adds.\n\nVictory is now advancing discussions with multiple strategic partners across the defence, aerospace, automotive, and semiconductor sectors seeking secure non-Chinese heavy rare earth supply.\n\nClark says the surge in yttrium pricing materially enhances Victory’s Prefeasibility Study (PFS), with the company continuing to integrate high value heavy rare earths including yttrium, dysprosium, terbium, and recently confirmed gallium into its economic modelling.\n\nThe CEO recently told shareholders at the company’s AGM that China’s moves to ban the export of key defence-related minerals such as terbium, dysprosium and scandium is an opportunity for Victory Metals to demonstrate its capability to produce these critical materials at scale and to help Australia become a key player in the global energy transition.\n\n*“We expect the PFS will define the processing pathway, costs, and production strategy for the North Stanmore project, and demonstrate how the underlying resources can be turned into a commercial, scalable operation,”* Clark says.\n\nClark notes an exhaustive PFS into Victory’s flagship North Stanmore Project, near Cue in Western Australia’s Mid West region, continues to indicate the project’s potential as one of the most advanced heavy rare earth clay-hosted deposits.\n\n> ***“We are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements”***\n\n*“Indications are we can avoid complex cracking or additional capital-intensive processing and environmental impacts, which further strengthens our value as a secure, reliable and capable potential supplier of high-purity feedstock to global processors,”* the CEO adds.\n\n*“With minimal processing under our proposed operating model, we are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements.”*\n\nOver the past 12 months, Clark says Victory has attracted strong international and institutional backing, and significant interest from government and private sector defence manufacturers around the world seeking secure off-take agreements.\n\nIn August 2025, the company raised $11.5 million through a placement of new shares to institutional, professional and sophisticated investors.\n\nIn October, Victory signed a non-binding LoI with Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation to advance offtake and strategic cooperation for North Stanmore, covering up to 30% of annual production, including up to 50 tonnes of Dy-Tb product over an initial five-year term.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank has also offered an LoI regarding funding support of US$190 million.\n\nVictory Metals is among a number of Australian rare earths explorers thrust into the global spotlight, following the landmark agreement between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to facilitate the investment of the billions of dollars needed to establish secure and reliable rare earth and critical minerals supply chains.\n\nWith the state of the market, [ABx Group]( (ASX:ABX) has also been ramping up efforts to become a significant player in rare earths space. It’s been raising $6.05 million through a placement to fund development activities at the Deep Leads Project in Tasmania and construction of the ALCORE pilot plant.\n\nFunds will be deployed to engineering and metallurgical studies, exploration drilling for a resource increase, and to secure offtake agreements for the Deep Leads Project.\n\nProceeds will also cover construction and commissioning costs of the ALCORE pilot plant to produce hydrogen and fluoride from aluminium smelter bath waste.\n\nThe Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ([ANSTO]( has started production of ABx’s first mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) product using 50kg of a 100kg bulk sample, with completion expected before the end of November 2025.\n\nThe sample will be distributed to potential customers and offtake partners for evaluation.\n\nABx is running a program to produce a saleable MREC product from its Deep Leads ionic adsorption clay rare earth project in Tasmania to be used in downstream refining to produce separated rare earth oxides, REE metals, and magnets essential for EV motors, guidance systems, wind turbines, and other clean-energy technologies.\n\nRare earth refineries (solvent-extraction plants) commonly accept MREC because it’s a standardised, transportable feedstock from which high-purity rare earth oxides and metals can be produced.\n\nIn partnership with external engineering experts, ABx conducted a formal processing options analysis. A key conclusion is that column leach tests should be conducted to confirm that the high extractions obtained in diagnostic leach tests in tanks are also observed in a column leach arrangement.\n\nANSTO is conducting initial column leach tests planned to begin in November, with results available by early 2026.\n\nManaging Director of emerging rare earths producer [OD6 Metals]( (ASX:OD6), Brett Hazelden, believes there is plenty of opportunity for Western countries like Australia to capture a substantial share of the burgeoning market dominated by China.\n\nRecently speaking to *Mining.com.au*, Hazelden says US President Donald Trump is changing the way governments work with private industry, which reshaping how government and private partnerships can work in an investor scheme to bolster Western supply chains.\n\nIf the Western world does not want all roads leading to China, Hazelden argues they need to obviously pay a fair price that allows people to make money but also allows them to participate in the next part of the value chain as well.\n\nThe make-up of OD6’s Splinter Rock Rare Earth Elements Project in Western Australia opens up a plethora of potential end-user avenues for the minnow. The emerging rare earths producer has proven it can produce a clean, high-quality mixed rare earth carbonate, which is a product highly sought after by several end users.\n\nOD6 has now identified another avenue for consideration down the track for the production of samarium and yttrium oxides, which are both used in nuclear reactors for clean power generation and nuclear medicine.\n\nSamarium is also used in the manufacture of high-temperature samarium-cobalt magnets for headphones, electric motors and aerospace applications.\n\nIn early October, OD6 elected a preferred [flowsheet]( with the aim of producing MREC and mixed rare earth hydroxide (MREH). Flowsheet testing undertaken by ANSTO achieved a MREC recovery of about 56% total rare earth oxide (TREO), and a MREH recovery of roughly 59% TREO.\n\nThe process demonstrated low levels of aluminium, iron, phosphorus and silicon impurities, and extremely low uranium and thorium content of less than 0.001%. Overall recoveries of the most in-demand magnet rare earths, neodymium and praseodymium, reached around 75% for OD6.\n\nThe high value magnet rare earths account for 23% of the TREO grade at Splinter Rock, which hosts a resource so far of 682 million tonnes @ 1,338 parts per million for 910,000 tonnes of contained TREO. The magnet rare earths provide about 205,000 tonnes of the contained resource.\n\nMining.com.au Editor-in-Chief Adam Orlando has more than 20 years’ experience in the media having held senior roles at various publications, including as Asia-Pacific Sector Head (Mining) at global newswire Acuris (formerly Mergermarket).

Notably, the sides agreed on enhanced pension system cooperation and signed a memorandum to advance veterinary services and agricultural research.\n\nKazakhstan’s National Academy of Sciences and Turkmenistan’s Academy of Sciences also agreed to increase research collaboration.\n\nAccording to [The Times of Central Asia]( Kazakhstan, long recognized for its substantial rare earth metals reserves, is moving beyond the familiar characterization of “underutilized potential” and is taking on a more active role in global critical material supply chains. The state-owned mining company Tau-Ken Samruk has become a key driver of this shift, expanding both at home and abroad.\n\nKazakhstan recently confirmed a new deposit with major reserves of cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and yttrium, strengthening its position as one of the few countries producing more than half of the known rare earth elements. The national strategy now centers on developing a full industrial cycle rather than exporting raw materials.\n\nA clear example of this change came in 2025, when Tau-Ken Samruk signed an agreement with U.S. based Cove Capital to develop the Severny Katpar and Verkhniy Kairakty tungsten deposits. A similar project with China’s Xiamen Tungsten collapsed in 2018 without binding commitments, highlighting growing geopolitical competition around Kazakhstan’s resources.\n\nThe country is also expanding internationally. According to Samruk-Kazyna chairman Nurlan Zhakupov, Kazakhstan aims to process materials from both domestic and foreign sources. “Tau-Ken Samruk is actively engaging with foreign partners,” he said, noting exploration projects underway in Rwanda and Afghanistan.\n\nThese efforts illustrate Kazakhstan’s ambition to secure a larger role in global supply chains. Despite political and security risks abroad, the country continues to pursue long-term partnerships and deeper integration into the rare earth market.\n\nWomen in Kazakhstan are reshaping the tech landscape, entering the sector from diverse backgrounds and driving new forms of innovation, [Euronews]( reports.\n\nA key figure in this movement is Assem Bolatzhan, who shifted from finance to IT in 2015 through the Digital Kazakhstan program.\n\n“We launched the Women in Tech chapter in Kazakhstan because we need to be part of a global community,” she says.\n\nAccording to Women in Tech Astana lead Rinata Ilyubayeva, nearly 60% of women-led startups focus on social impact.\n\n“Most female startups are in EdTech, HealthTech, and solutions for children with autism, elderly people, and pregnant women,” she notes.\n\nThe momentum has led to the creation of Central Asia’s first female-focused venture capital initiative.\n\n“We are building a platform to support women, because it’s not always easy,” says Ilyubayeva.\n\nEntrepreneurs like Aigerim Nurgaliyeva show how women without technical training can succeed.\n\n“The first obstacle was in my mind,” she says. “You can build a startup without coding.”\n\nSCAT Airlines (DV, Shymkent) is considering adding either B777 or B787 aircraft to its fleet for deliveries after 2030, Aviation Week has reported, citing senior marketing manager Zhanar Balgabay.\n\nAccording to [ch-aviation]( data, the Kazakh airline currently has commitments for seven more B737-8s and one additional B737-9.\n\nIts in-house fleet comprises one B737-300, three B737-500s, one B737-700, seven B737-8s, eight B737-800s, five B737-9s, two CRJ200ERs, and two CRJ200LRs.\n\nIn addition, three B757-200s and one B767-300ER are operated by subsidiary Sunday Airlines (Shymkent), which deploys the aircraft on charter services to destinations including Phuket, Dhaka, Moscow Vnukovo, Phu Quoc, and Nha Trang Cam Ranh.\n\nMeanwhile, SCAT Airlines has firmed plans to launch flights from Turkistan to Urgench, Bukhara, and Samarkand by December 2025.

To build them, it needs materials like copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese. Most of these metals come from mines that not only tear through forests and leave toxic tailings, but are also very expensive to build and maintain.\n\n**TMC The Metals Company** (NASDAQ: TMC) is pitching a different way to obtain these [metals]( In simple terms, it wants to vacuum rocks that contain these metals (\"\"nodules\"\") off the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n***Where to invest $1,000 right now?** Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the **10 best stocks** to buy right now. [**Continue »**](\n\nExcitement about the potential for this company helped boost the stock as much as 854% in 2025; however, the [mining stock]( is down about 49% from all-time highs hit in mid-October. For long-term investors, the underlying idea behind this company could be reason enough to buy this dip.\n\nImage source: The Metals Company.\n\nThe strongest argument supporting TMC's future growth is the combined net value of about $23.6 billion of the metals it expects to extract.\n\nIn August 2025, the company published two technical assessments that assigned that multibillion-dollar value to nodules in its exploratory area. Since the company is still only valued at about $2 billion, that project value gives its dreams some real economic backing.\n\nOn top of that, TMC ended its third quarter with about $115 million in cash, which should give a couple of years of runway with its current [cash burn rate](\n\nThe catch, of course, is that TMC does *not* have regulatory approval to mine the area under its exploratory control. Indeed, although it's been making progress on that front, the concrete steps needed to finally obtain that license are somewhat opaque at this moment.\n\nIf TMC can get through the regulatory process with a valid license to mine the seafloor for nodules, TMC's 385% gain so far in 2025 will be a prologue to something much bigger. Investors who are willing to make that bet could be rewarded, although be warned: This speculative stock will likely get bumpier until the road to mining is clear.\n\n## Should you invest $1,000 in TMC The Metals Company right now?\n\nThe *Motley Fool Stock Advisor* analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks]( for investors to buy now… and TMC The Metals Company wasn’t one of them.

[Yttrium]( (Y), [terbium]( (Tb), [erbium]( (Er), and [ytterbium]( (Yb) are all named after the village.\n\nOther elements including holmium, gadolinium, scandium, tantalum, and thulium were first discovered there, making Ytterby the richest source of naturally occurring elements on Earth.\n\nBack in 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius discovered a strange, unusually heavy black ore in an old quarry near Ytterby. This new ore was named by Arrhenius as ytterbite.\n\nTwo years later, a Finnish chemist identified from Arrhenius’ initial sample the first rare earth element – named yttrium. In just over 50 years following Arrhenius’ original discovery, Carl Gustav Mosander found that ytterbite was actually a mixture of three metal oxides, and a fourth was later discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac from the original sample.\n\nEventually as refining techniques improved, more new elements were discovered and ultimately over the next 100 years since Arrhenius’ discovery, nine more elements fell out of this strange, unusually heavy black ore.\n\nAmong these hard-to-pronounce elements is yttrium – a soft, grey-white metal that is fairly stable in air but reacts with water, acids, and bases.\n\nIt occurs in other ‘rare earth’ minerals, monazite and bastnaesite, though xenotime, which is mined in China and Malaysia, can contain up to 50% yttrium phosphate, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nYttrium metal is produced by reducing yttrium fluoride with calcium metal and is often used as an additive in alloys for its strengthening properties. When alloyed with aluminum, magnesium, and chromium, it acts to strengthen those metals.\n\nIn addition to its applications in speciality alloys found in engines, yttrium is used in coatings to shield against high temperatures.\n\nYttrium oxide is added to glass used to produce camera lenses as it makes them heat and shock resistant. It’s found in white LED lights as well as superconductors and lasers, with yttrium oxysulfide widely sought to produce red phosphors for old-style colour television tubes.\n\nLasers that can cut through metals require yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG), marking yet another of its many applications in everyday life.\n\nWhile its origins may come from Sweden, like other rare earths and critical minerals, China dominates global production and supply of yttrium. China supplies the US 93% of its yttrium imports, creating acute vulnerability across Western supply chains.\n\nThe world’s supplies are now running low due to Chinese export restrictions, sparking fears of looming protracted shortages, and rocketing costs that could hit every sector from aerospace, to energy and semiconductor production.\n\nOn the back of China restricting yttrium exports (along with six other rare earths in April in retaliation to the US tariffs) yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) prices have been soaring more than 4,000% in Europe in 2025.\n\nRecently, prices surpassed US$275/kg, as China’s tightening export controls disrupt global supply chains for military and defence, aerospace, semiconductors, and advanced materials. These shortages are also affecting markets related to high-temperature alloys, laser systems, avionics, and defence components.\n\nMagnet rare earth prices also remain high, with Benchmark reporting Dy oxide (DDP China) at over US$200/kg and Tb oxide (DDP China) at almost US$1,000/kg.\n\n[Victory Metals]( (ASX:VTM) CEO Brendan Clark says this global backdrop highlights the company’s strategic positioning as a major future yttrium supplier with what’s emerging as a valuable heavy rare earth basket.\n\nThe company’s current mineral resource hosts over 35 million kilograms of Y₂O₃ with forecast production targets over 600 tonnes annually tonnes along with strategic critical minerals dysprosium, terbium, neodymium and praseodymium, gallium, hafnium, and scandium.\n\nClark says yttrium is emerging as one of the world’s most important critical minerals and this global supply crunch is happening much faster than anyone expected.\n\n*“Our North Stanmore deposit continues to demonstrate the scale, grade, and mineralogy required to supply Western nations with secure, long-term yttrium supply,”* the CEO adds.\n\nVictory is now advancing discussions with multiple strategic partners across the defence, aerospace, automotive, and semiconductor sectors seeking secure non-Chinese heavy rare earth supply.\n\nClark says the surge in yttrium pricing materially enhances Victory’s Prefeasibility Study (PFS), with the company continuing to integrate high value heavy rare earths including yttrium, dysprosium, terbium, and recently confirmed gallium into its economic modelling.\n\nThe CEO recently told shareholders at the company’s AGM that China’s moves to ban the export of key defence-related minerals such as terbium, dysprosium and scandium is an opportunity for Victory Metals to demonstrate its capability to produce these critical materials at scale and to help Australia become a key player in the global energy transition.\n\n*“We expect the PFS will define the processing pathway, costs, and production strategy for the North Stanmore project, and demonstrate how the underlying resources can be turned into a commercial, scalable operation,”* Clark says.\n\nClark notes an exhaustive PFS into Victory’s flagship North Stanmore Project, near Cue in Western Australia’s Mid West region, continues to indicate the project’s potential as one of the most advanced heavy rare earth clay-hosted deposits.\n\n> ***“We are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements”***\n\n*“Indications are we can avoid complex cracking or additional capital-intensive processing and environmental impacts, which further strengthens our value as a secure, reliable and capable potential supplier of high-purity feedstock to global processors,”* the CEO adds.\n\n*“With minimal processing under our proposed operating model, we are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements.”*\n\nOver the past 12 months, Clark says Victory has attracted strong international and institutional backing, and significant interest from government and private sector defence manufacturers around the world seeking secure off-take agreements.\n\nIn August 2025, the company raised $11.5 million through a placement of new shares to institutional, professional and sophisticated investors.\n\nIn October, Victory signed a non-binding LoI with Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation to advance offtake and strategic cooperation for North Stanmore, covering up to 30% of annual production, including up to 50 tonnes of Dy-Tb product over an initial five-year term.\n\nThe Export-Import Bank has also offered an LoI regarding funding support of US$190 million.\n\nVictory Metals is among a number of Australian rare earths explorers thrust into the global spotlight, following the landmark agreement between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to facilitate the investment of the billions of dollars needed to establish secure and reliable rare earth and critical minerals supply chains.\n\nWith the state of the market, [ABx Group]( (ASX:ABX) has also been ramping up efforts to become a significant player in rare earths space. It’s been raising $6.05 million through a placement to fund development activities at the Deep Leads Project in Tasmania and construction of the ALCORE pilot plant.\n\nFunds will be deployed to engineering and metallurgical studies, exploration drilling for a resource increase, and to secure offtake agreements for the Deep Leads Project.\n\nProceeds will also cover construction and commissioning costs of the ALCORE pilot plant to produce hydrogen and fluoride from aluminium smelter bath waste.\n\nThe Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ([ANSTO]( has started production of ABx’s first mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) product using 50kg of a 100kg bulk sample, with completion expected before the end of November 2025.\n\nThe sample will be distributed to potential customers and offtake partners for evaluation.\n\nABx is running a program to produce a saleable MREC product from its Deep Leads ionic adsorption clay rare earth project in Tasmania to be used in downstream refining to produce separated rare earth oxides, REE metals, and magnets essential for EV motors, guidance systems, wind turbines, and other clean-energy technologies.\n\nRare earth refineries (solvent-extraction plants) commonly accept MREC because it’s a standardised, transportable feedstock from which high-purity rare earth oxides and metals can be produced.\n\nIn partnership with external engineering experts, ABx conducted a formal processing options analysis. A key conclusion is that column leach tests should be conducted to confirm that the high extractions obtained in diagnostic leach tests in tanks are also observed in a column leach arrangement.\n\nANSTO is conducting initial column leach tests planned to begin in November, with results available by early 2026.\n\nManaging Director of emerging rare earths producer [OD6 Metals]( (ASX:OD6), Brett Hazelden, believes there is plenty of opportunity for Western countries like Australia to capture a substantial share of the burgeoning market dominated by China.\n\nRecently speaking to *Mining.com.au*, Hazelden says US President Donald Trump is changing the way governments work with private industry, which reshaping how government and private partnerships can work in an investor scheme to bolster Western supply chains.\n\nIf the Western world does not want all roads leading to China, Hazelden argues they need to obviously pay a fair price that allows people to make money but also allows them to participate in the next part of the value chain as well.\n\nThe make-up of OD6’s Splinter Rock Rare Earth Elements Project in Western Australia opens up a plethora of potential end-user avenues for the minnow. The emerging rare earths producer has proven it can produce a clean, high-quality mixed rare earth carbonate, which is a product highly sought after by several end users.\n\nOD6 has now identified another avenue for consideration down the track for the production of samarium and yttrium oxides, which are both used in nuclear reactors for clean power generation and nuclear medicine.\n\nSamarium is also used in the manufacture of high-temperature samarium-cobalt magnets for headphones, electric motors and aerospace applications.\n\nIn early October, OD6 elected a preferred [flowsheet]( with the aim of producing MREC and mixed rare earth hydroxide (MREH). Flowsheet testing undertaken by ANSTO achieved a MREC recovery of about 56% total rare earth oxide (TREO), and a MREH recovery of roughly 59% TREO.\n\nThe process demonstrated low levels of aluminium, iron, phosphorus and silicon impurities, and extremely low uranium and thorium content of less than 0.001%. Overall recoveries of the most in-demand magnet rare earths, neodymium and praseodymium, reached around 75% for OD6.\n\nThe high value magnet rare earths account for 23% of the TREO grade at Splinter Rock, which hosts a resource so far of 682 million tonnes @ 1,338 parts per million for 910,000 tonnes of contained TREO. The magnet rare earths provide about 205,000 tonnes of the contained resource.\n\nMining.com.au Editor-in-Chief Adam Orlando has more than 20 years’ experience in the media having held senior roles at various publications, including as Asia-Pacific Sector Head (Mining) at global newswire Acuris (formerly Mergermarket).

China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing anytime soon.\n\nThe alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have [promised a truce over rare earth minerals]( the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.\n\nAlthough a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the [Chinese export restrictions]( introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.\n\nBut other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.\n\nYttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.\n\nThe problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.\n\nWhen Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty about delivery times. In the rare earths trade, lack of predictability is often more damaging than reduced volumes: An industry accustomed to just-in-time deliveries can be thrown into crisis by even a few weeks of delay.\n\nThe effects were immediate. In Europe, yttrium oxide prices have soared, reaching a 4,400 percent increase since the beginning of the year. Aerospace companies, which rely heavily on this material, have expressed alarm and demanded urgent measures from the US government to expand domestic production. The semiconductor industry is no less concerned: Some companies have called the situation a “serious” threat, predicting impacts on costs, efficiency, and production timelines. Gas-fired power plants, which use yttrium in the protective coatings of turbines, are also monitoring Chinese developments with increasing attention, although they maintain that they have not yet experienced disruptions.\n\nThe situation in warehouses outside China adds further layers of complexity. Available reserves, according to piecemeal estimates, range from one to 12 months, depending on the producers. Some traders have already reported running out of material; from quantities in the hundreds of tons range, many are down to just a few units. Others are completely out of stock. This volatility makes the market extremely fragile and underscores how the global supply chain depends on a small number of players.\n\nChinese exports to several countries have fallen by about 30 percent. China, which aims to become an autonomous tech powerhouse, therefore maintains a position of strength and a high degree of discretion, carefully regulating the quantities released to the international market. Moreover, the measures introduced by Beijing in the sector from the outset are flexible enough to allow it to modulate the flow of shipments according to political priorities.\n\nOn the political front, the trade truce between Washington and Beijing has yet to produce concrete results. The two sides have given negotiators until the end of November to outline clearer terms for rare earth exports to the United States, but the gap between their respective priorities remains wide. Beijing continues to work on a licensing system, inspired by mechanisms already used by the United States, that would allow for faster flow only to companies deemed to have no ties to the US military industry. This would leave many Western companies operating in the delicate boundary between civilian production and defense applications at a disadvantage, further complicating access to materials.\n\nChina's strategy involves not only controlling trade flows, but also managing technical expertise internationally. Authorities have begun requiring detailed lists of technicians specializing in rare earths, restricting their travel abroad and monitoring potential transfers of expertise to rival countries. At the same time, bans on the export of advanced rare earth processing technologies continue, a sector in which China holds a leadership position that is unlikely to be replicated in the short term. This dual approach—control of physical resources and human capital—strengthens Chinese primacy and hampers attempts to build an alternative supply chain.\n\nThe United States is nevertheless trying to fight back. New industrial projects, such as that of ReElement Technologies in Indiana, aim to produce yttrium oxide domestically starting in December, with an initial capacity of 200 tons per year, set to double within a few months. While this figure isn't enough to cover total US needs, it represents a first step toward diversification.\n\nDuring Trump's recent visit to Asia, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to jointly exploit the giant Minamitori undersea deposit, discovered years ago in the Pacific seabed. Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of a joint study to develop technologies and infrastructure capable of extracting these strategic materials from extreme ocean depths, a feat that will require enormous investment and advanced technical cooperation.\n\nYet the absence of a complete supply chain—from extraction to refining—makes the transition slow and complex. China has no intention of giving up its dominant position, a crucial and potentially decisive negotiating lever.\n\nTopics[China](/tag/china/)[manufacturing](/tag/manufacturing/)[materials](/tag/materials/)[Metal](/tag/metal/)[trade](/tag/trade/)\n\n*The Fantastic Four: First Steps*, *Thunderbolts\\**, and *Something Wicked This Way Comes* are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Disney+ this month.\n\nGet 10% off your first order at Western Digital when you register your email.\n\nEnjoy up to 50% off deliveries, free meals, and more with the latest Home Chef coupons.\n\nYou can snag a discount on all the Pixel 10 phone varieties if you act fast.\n\nThis $400 set comes with minifigures of the complete Next Gen crew, including Picard, Riker, and Wesley Crusher’s portable tractor beam.\n\nSave hundreds on our preferred MacBook for most people.\n\nAll-Clad cookware is the best you can buy—and it has a price tag to match.

Notably, the sides agreed on enhanced pension system cooperation and signed a memorandum to advance veterinary services and agricultural research.\n\nKazakhstan’s National Academy of Sciences and Turkmenistan’s Academy of Sciences also agreed to increase research collaboration.\n\nAccording to [The Times of Central Asia]( Kazakhstan, long recognized for its substantial rare earth metals reserves, is moving beyond the familiar characterization of “underutilized potential” and is taking on a more active role in global critical material supply chains. The state-owned mining company Tau-Ken Samruk has become a key driver of this shift, expanding both at home and abroad.\n\nKazakhstan recently confirmed a new deposit with major reserves of cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and yttrium, strengthening its position as one of the few countries producing more than half of the known rare earth elements. The national strategy now centers on developing a full industrial cycle rather than exporting raw materials.\n\nA clear example of this change came in 2025, when Tau-Ken Samruk signed an agreement with U.S. based Cove Capital to develop the Severny Katpar and Verkhniy Kairakty tungsten deposits. A similar project with China’s Xiamen Tungsten collapsed in 2018 without binding commitments, highlighting growing geopolitical competition around Kazakhstan’s resources.\n\nThe country is also expanding internationally. According to Samruk-Kazyna chairman Nurlan Zhakupov, Kazakhstan aims to process materials from both domestic and foreign sources. “Tau-Ken Samruk is actively engaging with foreign partners,” he said, noting exploration projects underway in Rwanda and Afghanistan.\n\nThese efforts illustrate Kazakhstan’s ambition to secure a larger role in global supply chains. Despite political and security risks abroad, the country continues to pursue long-term partnerships and deeper integration into the rare earth market.\n\nWomen in Kazakhstan are reshaping the tech landscape, entering the sector from diverse backgrounds and driving new forms of innovation, [Euronews]( reports.\n\nA key figure in this movement is Assem Bolatzhan, who shifted from finance to IT in 2015 through the Digital Kazakhstan program.\n\n“We launched the Women in Tech chapter in Kazakhstan because we need to be part of a global community,” she says.\n\nAccording to Women in Tech Astana lead Rinata Ilyubayeva, nearly 60% of women-led startups focus on social impact.\n\n“Most female startups are in EdTech, HealthTech, and solutions for children with autism, elderly people, and pregnant women,” she notes.\n\nThe momentum has led to the creation of Central Asia’s first female-focused venture capital initiative.\n\n“We are building a platform to support women, because it’s not always easy,” says Ilyubayeva.\n\nEntrepreneurs like Aigerim Nurgaliyeva show how women without technical training can succeed.\n\n“The first obstacle was in my mind,” she says. “You can build a startup without coding.”\n\nSCAT Airlines (DV, Shymkent) is considering adding either B777 or B787 aircraft to its fleet for deliveries after 2030, Aviation Week has reported, citing senior marketing manager Zhanar Balgabay.\n\nAccording to [ch-aviation]( data, the Kazakh airline currently has commitments for seven more B737-8s and one additional B737-9.\n\nIts in-house fleet comprises one B737-300, three B737-500s, one B737-700, seven B737-8s, eight B737-800s, five B737-9s, two CRJ200ERs, and two CRJ200LRs.\n\nIn addition, three B757-200s and one B767-300ER are operated by subsidiary Sunday Airlines (Shymkent), which deploys the aircraft on charter services to destinations including Phuket, Dhaka, Moscow Vnukovo, Phu Quoc, and Nha Trang Cam Ranh.\n\nMeanwhile, SCAT Airlines has firmed plans to launch flights from Turkistan to Urgench, Bukhara, and Samarkand by December 2025.

They want to see value created in the state, jobs, revenues – it’s a really good time to be working in Queensland.”*\n\nIltani is [receiving]( an $8 million investment from the Queensland Investment Corporation’s (QIC) Critical Minerals and Battery Technology Fund (QCMBTF) to further develop the Orient Project.\n\nThe total grant comprises $6 million in cash in exchange for a 2% royalty on future product sales from the greater Herberton Project if commercial production begins by the end of 2030, otherwise boosting to 2.5%, as well as $2 million cash for the issue of 5.41 million shares.\n\nShares will be issued at $0.37 each, indicating a 10% discount to the 20-day volume weighted average price prior to the agreement.\n\n*“Now with the funding from the QIC, we’ll build on what we’ve got and do more,”* Garner adds.\n\nThe QIC is a state government-owned corporation that manages the QCMBTF to bolster businesses focused on supporting Queensland’s critical minerals supply chain, holding $131.6 billion worth of assets under management as of 30 June 2025.\n\nGarner explains that while the Iltani’s main priority is exploring the Orient Project, the company is always looking for opportunities to *“create value for shareholders”.*\n\n*“If we don’t look, we won’t find and you’ll never know when we’ll come across one of those,”* Garner says.\n\n*“We’re growing the team at Orient to make sure we deliver the best possible project for our shareholders and for Queensland.”*\n\nThe company will focus on drill targets inside the Caldera Complex including the Boonmoo gold and Union Jack base metal targets, before mapping the Orient and Antimony Reward projects.\n\n*“Once we understand the controls of the mineralisation, we might go back to Antimony Reward but our main focus is at Orient,”* Garner tells [*Mining.com.au*](\n\nThe Antimony Reward deposit sits roughly 17km from Orient, also within the Herberton Project in Queensland.\n\nIltani completed initial drilling at the asset in 2024, with assays [returning]( 7m @ 7.61% antimony from 38m, including 3m @ 8.19% from 38m and 1m @ 26.70% from 43m in hole ARRC001.\n\nHole ARRC003 intersected 3m @ 0.75% antimony from 31m, including 1m @ 1.25% from 32m; and 4m @ 0.43%, including 1m @ 1.28% from 42m, while hole ARRC004 intersected 9m @ 0.94% from 53m, including 2m @ 2.66% from 60m.\n\nIltani Resources is a mineral explorer focused on the discovery and development of critical minerals for a clean energy future.\n\nAs day one of *Mining.com.au*’s 12 days of Christmas series comes to a close, Iltani’s discovery highs in 2025 sets the tone for the next year and the next door on our advent calendar.\n\nMaddison is a recent journalism and business graduate with a passion for crafting impactful stories.

They're not hard to find if you know where to look. Such stocks with [multibagger]( potential are often hidden among leaders in fast-growing industries, first movers in industries with exponential potential, and innovative start-ups that are shaping the future.\n\nTwo such stocks have caught my attention. Each has such compelling growth prospects that buying them now and holding them could yield monster returns over the next five years or so.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nRare-earth elements technically aren't rare, but it's not easy to extract them in ways that are economically viable. China has a monopoly, accounting for almost 70% of the global rare-earth extraction. That also means [80% of the rare-earth elements consumed in the U.S.]( are imported, with nearly all of them coming from China.\n\nThat's not a great place to be. Rare-earth elements are vital for electronics, semiconductors, robotics, [defense]( and aerospace technologies, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and more. However, China's dominance poses significant supply risks to the U.S. Additionally, it has always disincentivized U.S. [mining]( companies from pouring money into rare-earth elements. President Donald Trump wants to change that and, therefore, has allocated billions of dollars to critical mineral projects, even buying stakes in some domestic producers to secure U.S. supply chains.\n\nThere is only one active rare-earth mine in the U.S.: the Mountain Pass in California, owned and operated by **MP Materials** ([MP](/quote/nyse/mp/) +2.99%).\n\nIn July 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense, rebranded as the Department of War (DOW) by Trump, acquired a 15% stake in MP Materials and became its largest shareholder. MP Materials will build a rare-earth magnet manufacturing facility, known as the 10X facility, with the DOW committing to purchase 100% of the rare-earth magnets produced at the facility for 10 years. Two of its other major deals include:\n\n* A $500 million multiyear agreement with tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](/quote/nasdaq/aapl/) +0.46%) to supply magnets.\n\n* A partnership with the DOW and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to develop a rare-earth refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nMP Materials currently produces rare-earth oxides and metals and will begin production of magnets by the end of 2025. [MP Materials stock already carries a market cap of $10 billion]( but that could look minuscule five years from now.\n\nShares of **Symbotic** ([SYM](/quote/nasdaq/sym/) 4.04%) have surged over 250% so far in 2025, as of this writing. And there could be a lot more to come.\n\nSymbotic automates warehouses and distribution centers with [artificial intelligence (AI)]( [robotics]( that can move, store, and sort items. Symbotic went public in 2022 but has been working with **Walmart** ([WMT](/quote/nyse/wmt/) +1.31%) since 2015 to deploy robotic systems at multiple distribution centers. In January 2025, Symbotic acquired Walmart's advanced systems and robotics (ASR) business for automated fulfillment of orders, a new product category for Symbotic.\n\nUnder yet another new and recent agreement, Symbotic will develop and install automated micro-fulfillment systems for online pickup and delivery at Walmart's retail stores. Symbotic expects its first prototype to be ready in 2026. Meanwhile, Symbotic is developing a next-generation storage technology as well. Besides Walmart, Symbotic's other customers include **Albertsons**, C&S Wholesale Grocers, GreenBox, and **Target**.\n\nSymbotic has also just announced something big: It has signed up Medline as a customer, marking its foray into healthcare. [Medline is a major distributor of medical supplies]( in the U.S. and is expected to go public soon. Symbotic deployed its first system to Medline last quarter.\n\nSymbotic's entry into healthcare marks a significant milestone, as it opens up a new vertical for the company beyond retail and could fast-track its sales growth. Symbotic just posted a 26% growth in revenue for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 27, 2025, and projects similar growth for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.\n\nMost importantly, Symbotic ended the year with a backlog of $22.5 billion. That's huge, as it represents nearly a decade's worth of sales. So, even though Symbotic's market cap has surpassed $50 billion, its estimated addressable market runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars, making it a solid stock to own for the long term.\n\nBoth MP Materials and Symbotic share a common link -- they have the first-mover advantage in their respective industries, *and* both industries have exponential growth potential. That's what makes these stocks so appealing. Growth stocks carry their share of risks, but with both Symbotic and MP Materials already generating revenue and striking significant partnerships, they're worth the risk.\n\nNeha Chamaria is a contributing Motley Fool stock market analyst covering energy, industrials, utilities, and materials sectors, with a focus on dividend stocks.

LKY is anticipating a ‘[**continuous flow of exploration news and data through Q1 and Q2 of 2026**](\n\n**WCE** hit silver in [**5 out of 8 zones**](/quick-takes/wce-hits-visible-silver-at-the-elizabeth-hill-mine-in-wa/) from its latest diamond drillholes.\n\n*The results were from handheld XRF readings - so we will need to wait for final assays from these holes (due in mid-December).*\n\n**BPM** released an update on [**its rare earth project**](/quick-takes/bpm-samples-rare-earth-oxide-grades-up-to-965-in-wa/) in WA.\n\n*Rock chips grading up to 9.65% TREO, within a newly confirmed 5km of mineralised strike... but most importantly, the same type of rocks that Iluka is looking to feed through its WA refinery that is under construction.*\n\nThe bigger news from **BPM** this week was that it [**raised $3.5M to help expand and accelerate drilling**](/quick-takes/bpm-raises-funds-drilling-on-wa-gold-asset-to-start-in-few-days/) at its WA gold project (*which should start in the coming weeks*).\n\n**ILA** was [**added to the Medical Countermeasures Coalition**](/quick-takes/ila-added-to-a-coalition-of-companies-which-includes-multi-billion-dollar-big-pharma-companies/) (MC2) to advance US procurement and stockpiling opportunities.\n\n*Some interesting names make up that coalition, including a few who have a proven track record developing drugs that went onto get big US stockpiling deals.*\n\n**PNN** announced [**results from a drill program**](/quick-takes/pnn-now-weeks-away-from-10000m-drill-program-on-brazilian-rare-earths-asset/) on its Brazilian rare earth project.\n\n*The results were from a shallow auger program, and delivered further high grade niobium and rare earths results...*\n\n*Next PNN will kick off the first phase of a 10,000m RC drill program (due to start in December) ahead of a “maiden resource in Q1-2026”.*\n\n**SGQ** hit [**extensions to its already large rare earths resource**](/quick-takes/sgq-hits-extensions-to-the-biggest-rare-earths-resources-deposit-in-south-america/) in Brazil.\n\n*SGQ has 3 rigs drilling 24/7, 29 assays in the lab and 40 more holes planned... so we should see more good news like this week’s results over the coming weeks/months.*\n\n**KAU** is looking at ways [**to get more feed**](/quick-takes/kau-to-drill-waste-dumps-next-to-victorian-processing-plant/) through its processing plant in Victoria...\n\n*One of those had samples with grades of 0.86g/t, the other 1.8g/t... both very processable grades especially so close to KAU’s Victorian plant and an all time high gold price.*\n\n**ION** raised $4.4M to “*Advance E-Waste Recycling Opportunities in the USA*”.\n\n*We participated in ION’s capital raise - we especially liked that there was almost no discount to the market price AND the board participated in the round (both good signals for a capital raise).*\n\n**LSR** started its [**first exploration program**](/quick-takes/lsr-starts-exploration-on-us-heavy-rare-earths-project/) on its project in Arizona.\n\n*Previous sampling at LSR’s project showed 0.53-1.26% TREO, importantly with ~57% heavy rare earths (the valuable ones).*\n\n*The big win for us will be if LSR can show those same grades are consistent across a bigger part of its project.*\n\n**SS1** [**released another drill result**](/quick-takes/ss1-hits-silver-and-gold-26m-above-its-existing-480m-ounce-silver-equivalent-resource/) from its 2025 drill program.\n\n*The kicker for us was that mineralisation in the assay results started a lot closer to surface compared to where SS1’s resource estimate begins.*\n\n*Near surface results could be a game changer for SS1’s project, removing all of the risks related to pre-stripping a deep orebody (i.e. mining the waste rock above the existing resource).*\n\n**HAR** [**completed its second round of drilling**](/quick-takes/har-completes-drilling-on-gold-project-assay-results-coming-next-month/) on its gold project in Senegal.\n\n*HAR is following up the results from a few months ago including the 20m intercept grading 6.54g/t gold.*\n\n*HAR is moving very quickly here (which always makes us pay a lot more attention) and has already committed to deeper RC/diamond drilling in early 2026.*\n\nThis week **HAR** also [**confirmed a drill rig is on site**](/quick-takes/har-to-start-drilling-on-us-gold-project-today/) at its US based gold project in California **AND that drilling was scheduled to have started on the night shift of Friday 28th November.**\n\nThe goal is to convert the current resource to JORC compliant, and HAR expects to complete this by late January 2026.\n\n**TTM** [**released more drill results**](/quick-takes/ttm-results-set-to-add-to-resource-as-lingbao-prepares-for-another-visit/) from its 3.1Moz gold and 22Moz silver project in Ecuador.\n\n*More interesting to us though was the confirmation, strategic investor Lingbao was “preparing a second site visit” as part of its due diligence toward doing a potential project level transaction with TTM for the Dynasty Gold Project.*\n\n**88E** put out an [**update on its projects in Alaska**](/quick-takes/88e-to-flow-test-well-next-to-711m-neighbour/), USA.\n\n*88E is fully carried for all costs associated with an upcoming horizontal well and extended flow test. 88E’s farm in partner is Burgundy Xploration, who is gearing up for an IPO in the US to support operational spend.*\n\n**MNB** provided an [**update for its Cabinda phosphate project**](/quick-takes/mnb-update-on-angolan-phosphate-project/) in Angola.\n\n*IF the alternative structure can be pulled off, MNB could be fast-tracking first production by simplifying its processing flowsheet, removing crushing, drying, and dust extraction to cut ~$20M in CAPEX and $17/t operating costs.*\n\n*There is a fair bit to go through the announcement - Long story short, there looks to be a delay in the first production date mentioned months ago.*\n\n**TG1** [**identified unmapped historical workings**](/quick-takes/tg1-finds-unmapped-historic-workings-on-recently-acquired-project/) at its Dalgaranga Gold Project in WA.\n\n*TG1’s new project sits in a relatively well understood part of WA so it was a surprise to find unmapped historic workings. - a small open pit mined at 2.5g/t gold and multiple shallow workings.*\n\n*Usually these historic workings are found on remote sites - so we liked that announcement from TG1.*\n\n**L1M** [**raised $2.5M to fund drilling**](/quick-takes/l1m-raises-25m-exploration-programs-to-start-early-next-year/) on its QLD and NSW assets.\n\n*We participated in the raise and we are looking forward to Phase 2 of L1M drilling its Queensland gold asset, following up the encouraging mineralisation it hit during Phase 1 drilling in recent months.*\n\n**EIQ** has developed (and is already in the market with) an AI-powered algorithm that helps cardiologists detect heart diseases.\n\nEIQ’s tech is already USA FDA approved AND being used by a growing number of hospitals in the USA to detect one heart disease called Aortic Stenosis.\n\n**Earlier this week EIQ announced results of a clinical validation study on a different heart disease - Heart Failure.**\n\nHeart Failure is one of the big heart diseases - US$60BN is spent on it, 1 in 4 Americans will get it, and it's the leading cause of rehospitalisation.\n\nEIQ’s clinical validation study was run by the prestigious Mayo Clinic. The study delivered exceptional results on **detecting heart failure with 99.5% sensitivity and 91.0% specificity** ([source](\n\nMuch better than the only other AI heart failure detection software used in the market today which delivers **sensitivity of 87.8% and specificity of 81.9%** ([source](\n\n(Both technologies are a step change from current practices where only 50% of Heart Failure cases are accurately diagnosed.)\n\nIF EIQ can get FDA approval for its Heart Failure AI model, there already exists a reimbursement code the company can use to commercialise its AI tech.\n\nThe reimbursement code exists thanks to Ultromics (who [raised US$55M]( in a series C funding round valuing them at US$300M / A$464M back in July).\n\nNow we watch for FDA clearance...\n\n**IIQ** is developing an exosome platform technology.\n\nIIQ is applying its exosome platform to develop diagnostics (detecting diseases) AND therapeutics (treating diseases).\n\nExosomes are tiny, microscopic extra-cellular “containers” that carry ‘messages’ between the human body's cells that allows the human body to function.\n\n**IIQ is going after two types of cancer that have NO approved/recommended treatments or diagnostic tools.**\n\n* Ovarian cancer is usually asymptomatic (no symptoms) in the early stages of the disease. If a woman is diagnosed at stage 1 - the survival rates can be over 90%. If a woman is diagnosed at stages 3/4 survival rates can be ~29%. ~70% of all ovarian cancer in Australia is diagnosed as advanced [stage 3 or 4 cancer](\n\n* At the moment there are no recommended screening tests for women who show no symptoms of ovarian cancer - meaning there is no quick and easy screening test that can be regularly taken by all healthy women to catch ovarian cancer early.\n\n* **IIQ’s screening test has been able to detect all stage 1 and 2 ovarian cancers (the earliest but asymptomatic stages where survival rates are the highest), with over 99.6% specificity (catching 99.6% of all patients with cancer) AND NO misdiagnosis.**\n\n* **What’s Next:** IIQ to do a larger clinical validation study (to see if the test works on a larger cohort of patients) then look at “strategic partnering” to commercialise the screening tool.\n\n* Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of breast cancer that does NOT respond to traditional breast cancer therapies.\n\n* At the moment, there are no approved cell therapies treating triple negative breast cancer.\n\n* IIQ is developing the therapeutic under a deal signed with the prestigious Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Peter Mac) in Melbourne. The institution is among only a handful globally that combines a dedicated cancer hospital with a fully integrated cancer research program.\n\n* **So far IIQ has shown that its therapeutic was able to kill more than 90% of the cancer cells within 10 hours of treatment in in vitro studies (in a laboratory setting).**\n\n* **What’s next:** Next for the therapeutic is the results from animal studies (in-vivo) due this quarter.\n\nWe think that any solid tumour therapeutic IIQ is able to develop could be a game changer for the company.\n\nMainly because it would de-risk IIQ’s platform tech (if it works for one cancer, why wouldn't it work for others?)...\n\nWe called **BKB** our 2025 Next Investors Small Cap Pick of the Year because it acquired 100% of a previously producing, high grade silver project, in Texas, USA.\n\nWhile it sits in Texas USA, geologically, it actually sits on Mexico’s famous Sierra Madre belt, which is home to some of the world’s biggest silver producers.\n\n**We want to see BKB get this project back into production as quickly as possible, while silver prices are at all time highs** (we think the silver price could go on a generational run over the coming years and have positioned our Portfolio for this scenario).\n\nAND in the nearer term, we want to see the BKB team execute on their plan to restart their silver mine and processing plant in Texas while drilling out to grow their in ground silver resource.\n\nThis week BKB announced high grade rock chips OUTSIDE of the existing silver resource (grades up to 3,100 g/t silver):\n\nSilver gapped up almost 10% this week so all eyes on the open for this one tomorrow.\n\n**EXR** is the biggest net acreage holder in the Taroom Trough - second only to supermajor $320BN Shell.\n\nEXR just did a deal with the #3 landholder in the region - Omega Oil and Gas.\n\nOmega took a 19.43% position in EXR in exchange for $13.9M at 4.1c per share.\n\nOmega is backed by Tri-Star (pioneers of the Queensland gas industry) and it recently did a deal with ~$2.8BN Beach Energy.\n\nAfter all is said and done EXR will have a $35.3M capital budget to work with.\n\nAND next, EXR is drilling a vertical well targeting a ~1 trillion cubic feet of contingent gas resource (estimate).\n\nDrilling starts in January...\n\nAnd then a horizontal section, with stimulating and testing will follow straight after.\n\nIt all kicks off on the 12th of January according to the EXR MD and CEO Stuart Nicholls in a webinar a few days ago. ([Source - watch it here](\n\nWe also noticed that were two specific conditions as part of Omega’s investment in EXR.\n\nFirst the “standstill” - which means Omega can’t buy any more shares in EXR for at least 12 months - basically EXR is given a 12-month period to deliver material catalysts (like the Lorelle drilling and horizontal well)...\n\nAnd second, the support condition - which basically means if EXR were to attract a takeover offer within the next 12 months from someone OTHER THAN Omega, Omega wouldn't be able to block the transaction (UNLESS they are willing to match/beat the proposal).\n\nWe think this is a very good deal for EXR shareholders, especially if the January drill results come in...\n\n**After this week’s deal, the clear front runners in the Taroom Trough are EXR/Omega and then $320BN Shell...**\n\n**Bloomberg -** While stablecoins are set on revolutionising payments, [**200-year-old lessons from America's free-banking era**]( could determine whether they survive real-world financial stress.\n\n**Bloomberg -** Global silver market tightens as [**China’s stockpiles plummet to decade-low**]( record exports surge, and near-term prices climb in backwardation.\n\n**Bloomberg -** Beijing [**mixes trade power and diplomacy at G-20**]( curbing rare earth exports while rolling out a new international mining initiative.\n\n**Mining.com -** [**US backs Brazil’s Serra Verde**]( with $465M funding to boost rare earth production, cutting Western reliance on China for critical minerals.\n\nThat isn't the first time US capital has made its way into Brazilian rare earths space... good news for our Investment in Brazil [**SGQ**](/company/asx-sgq/).\n\n**Bloomberg -** UK unveils plan to produce 10% of critical minerals domestically and [**recycle 20% by 2035**]( with £50M backing local industry.\n\n*Our Investment* [***ION***](/company/asx-ion/) *is currently getting its foot in the door in the US and has already taken early steps toward doing the same in Europe...*\n\n**Reuters -** EXIM announces [**$100BN investment to stabilize US and allied critical minerals**]( nuclear, and LNG supply chains amid global shortages.\n\n**The Telegraph -** A [**Marburg virus outbreak in Ethiopia**]( has already killed five and is spreading fast near Kenyan and South Sudan’s borders, experts warn of high fatality risk.\n\n*A terrible disease that we hope one day our Investment ILA’s Marburg drug can help tackle:* [***ILA: Our Biotech Pick of the Year***](/articles/ila-our-biotech-pick-of-the-year/)\n\n[***Mithril Silver and Gold (ASX: MTH) - Updated Resource for Silver Gold Project in Mexico Coming in Q1 2026***](\n\n[***Echo IQ (ASX: EIQ) - Investor Briefing: Exceptional Results for EchoSolv HF Validation Study***](\n\n[***One of America’s Biggest Gold Wholesalers Exposes the Most Common Gold Scam Enslaving the Country***](\n\n[**Locksley Resources (ASX: LKY | OTCQX: LKYRF) CEO Kerrie Matthews was on site and getting amongst the flurry of activity underway at its Mojave project in California**](\n\n## A word of caution...\n\nWhile we aim to highlight developments in the small cap space, investing in early-stage and small cap companies - like those we cover - is inherently risky.\n\nThese companies often face funding challenges, regulatory hurdles, and market volatility.

These pared-down EVs lower the starting cost, making it easier for more people to own a Tesla.\n\nThis change is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both cars, I see it as a move that could significantly boost Tesla ownership.\n\nThe idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by eliminating the extras that most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move.\n\nIt comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be seeking more affordable options. According to June figures from [Kelley Blue Book]( the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $49,077, while EVs cost $57,245 on average. That's lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about $10,500 higher than five years ago.\n\n## How much do Tesla's cheaper cars cost, and what do they come with?\n\nThe Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD.\n\nInside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, as well as textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and four-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen, eliminating the need for physical buttons.\n\nTesla includes a seven-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not.\n\n*Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.* [*Add CNET*]( *as a preferred Google source.*\n\nThe rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed internally with a fabric headliner for improved insulation, and the mirrors are manually folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter.\n\nThe Model Y Standard comes standard with 18-inch wheels, with 19-inch wheels available as an optional upgrade, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.\n\nMeanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.\n\nTesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation.\n\nIt retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.\n\nCharging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options.\n\nBoth cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.\n\n[Full Self-Driving]( is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance.\n\nI think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.\n\nIn my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet.\n\nPricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.\n\nFor now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.\n\nConnor is a technology writer and editor, with a byline on multiple platforms.

Keep a keen eye on the Federal Reserve and tech.\n\n* Major stock indices gained, with S&P 500 ending near its 52-week high.\n\n* Market optimism was driven by Fed comments suggesting possible rate cuts and economic slowdown concerns.\n\n* An end-of-year rally may continue unless disrupted by major events or shocks.\n\nOut of nowhere, on a holiday week no less, it seemed the stock market got a bid.\n\nThe result was weekly gains for all the major averages. The Standard & Poor’s 500 ended about 1% below its 52-week high, and Eli Lilly ended the week still sporting a market capitalization of $1 trillion.\n\nIn the process, the pharmaceutical giant joined [Berkshire Hathaway]( as the only non-tech related companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more.\n\n* Can the stock market continue its bullish run?\n\n* What’s the outlook for December?\n\n* Can we start to hazard a guess about 2026?\n\nTheoretically, the run can continue its run this week and maybe into next week when the [Federal Reserve]( meets to discuss interest rates and the economy. The consensus (if the [CME]( Group’s FedWatch tool is an indicator) is a rate cut is probable.\n\nHawks push pause, doves seek cuts as traders mull rate-cut bet.\n\nJohn Williams, a key Fed official (because he’s president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank), said the risks of an economic slowdown were bigger than more [inflation]( So, interest rate could come down.\n\nMoreover, the [S&P 500]( (and the market generally) has just enjoyed five straight gains and ended Friday only 1% below its 6,920 all-time high reached on Oct. 29.\n\nWe should add the rally was basically prompted by Williams’ speech, given in Chile on Nov, 21.\n\nAs a result, something would have to derail the market. It would have to be an event: A shock runup in bond yields or oil prices, a terrorism attack, explosion in the Middle East or Ukraine, a sudden resignation no one expects.\n\nTJX Companies store brands are overcoming a major headwind.\n\nCould that mean the market could rally through to December as well? Maybe. There are only 22 trading days left in 2025. So, again, you need an abrupt, serious problem.\n\nThe market’s recent [pullback]( was set off by worries that Big Tech, especially Meta Platforms, Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla and Oracle, was investing too much money on artificial intelligence capacity. That is, huge data centers filled with racks of computers tied together with [AI]( chips.\n\nThat worry is probably still on many investors’ minds, but you won’t see it erupt again until the latter half of January when fourth-quarter earnings reports start.\n\nThis is not to deny the attention the recent market pullback received.  Through Nov. 20, the S&P 500 and fell 5.5% and the Nasdaq Composite fell more than 8% after hitting all-time highs on Oct. 29. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.5% from its all-time high, reached on Nov. 12.) The pullback was a surprise, and it actually did need a catalyst to calm investors.\n\nThe catalyst was John Williams’ speech.\n\nHis speech puts a floor under the market for now. And we wait for the Fed’s big event.\n\nGM is continuing to right size its EV production.\n\nNovember, normally one of the better months of the year, closed flat to modestly lower. [Nvidia]( was down 12.6%. Microsoft dropped 5%. Meta slipped 1%. Alphabet jumped almost 14%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow were basically flat. The Nasdaq and Nasdaq-100 Index each fell about 1.5%.\n\nThree interesting exceptions: Walmart jumped 9.2% in November. Berkshire Hathaway rose 7.6% as [Warren Buffett]( prepares to step down as CEO at the end of the month. [Costco]( Wholesale was up slightly, thanks to a 3.1% gain starting after Monday.\n\nAnd interest rates mostly moved lower anticipating the Fed’s Dec. 10 decision. The 10-year Treasury bond was yielding about 4% on Friday, down from 4.6% when 2025 opened. The 30-year mortgage rate is just above 6.2%, down from 7.25% in January.\n\n* The S&P 500 finished Friday up 16.45% for the year.\n\n* The Nasdaq is up 21% for 2025.\n\n* The Dow industrials are up 12.2%.\n\n* The Russell 2000 Index is up 12.1%.\n\nPart of the unease about the market in recent weeks has much to do with how the gains have been built.\n\nConsider the S&P 500. About 49% of its 38.6% total return since the market bottom in April 2025 (stock price gain plus [dividends]( came just from the Magnificent Seven stocks: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, according to S&P Senior Index analyst Howard Silverblatt.\n\nWhen asked, Silverblatt said he didn’t believe the S&P 500’s total return in any period was so dominated by such a small group of stocks.\n\nFor the year to date, the index is up 17.8% on a total return basis. Without the Mag Seven stocks, the total return falls to 10.24%.\n\nThe latest round of earnings reports is winding up with just 111 companies reporting quarterly results this week. Here are the key reports:\n\n* Credo Technology, maker of connectors for computer applications.\n\n* Database developer MongoDB.\n\n* Discount retailer DollarTree.\n\n* Three Canadian banking giants: Toronto Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\n\nTriple-digit growth meets Wall Street skepticism as Palantir battles AI bubble fears.\n\nCharley Blaine writes about stocks and financial markets, bonds and interest rates, oil and other commodities, and the economy.

Today I found another one. Though, it actually launched a little before the Tesla one. It’s a new hub with 18 fast chargers for fleet vehicles. The [press release]( from Terawatt Infrastructure says the source of electricity is renewables. “Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session.”\n\nThe location is Rialto, California, about 56 miles east of Los Angeles. The new fleet charging hub provides:\n\n* 24/7 security with 360-degree cameras and gated access to protect vehicles, cargo, and drivers.\n\nFor people who might think this new site is just a one-off, Terawatt opened a similarly sized hub [in April]( “The private site, shared among multiple fleets, will house a total of 20 pull-through and bobtail DC fast charging stalls and boast a capacity of 7MW — enabling charging for up to 125 trucks per day.”\n\nBut let’s get back to the [Rialto hub]( “The Rialto site brings Terawatt’s vision of a connected, electrified network to life. It provides fast, reliable, and high-speed pull-through charging along an electric lane that runs from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles through Vernon and Commerce, culminating in Rialto. Our network enables companies to reduce emissions and run a variety of routes across a number of vehicle classes with the confidence of a dependable charging solution. EV fleets can now travel further, more cleanly, without slowing down their operations,” said Neha Palmer, CEO and co-founder of Terawatt.\n\nSolar power canopies generate electricity and don’t require vast amounts of land. They also provide shade and protection from precipitation.\n\nThere has been much good news about new EV charger installations lately, despite the loss of the federal EV incentives and a Trump administration that is anti-EV.\n\nUsing fully electric medium- and-heavy-duty freight trucks reduces harmful air pollution because they don’t burn diesel fuel or gasoline. There are some environmental benefits as well.\n\n* In the five-county region of Southern California, **119,200 workers** are employed in the EV industry, which is 43.4 percent of all statewide jobs (275,600) in the EV industry.\n\n* In California, the EV industry pays an average annual wage of $91,300, well above the average annual wage across all industries of $68,500.\n\n*Sign up for [CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries]( sign up for [our daily newsletter]( and [follow us on Google News](\n\n*Have a tip for CleanTechnica?

(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nMusk reposted the 38-second video on his X profile, which was originally created by Alex Utopia and shows Tesla's humanoid robots doing a variety of everyday jobs. Since Musk posted the clip, it has racked up over 58.5 million views.\n\nThe montage shows Optimus walking down the street. It then cuts to a construction site where the robot supports workers. The clip shifts to a scene of Optimus providing emergency aid during a disaster drill. Next, you see Optimus inside a judo gym, sparring with a trainer.\n\nAfter that, the robot appears on an urban police patrol. The tone shifts again when Optimus lands in a casino dealing cards at a blackjack table. Then you can see it walking on the beach, and then it is shown in a restaurant kitchen where it cooks a meal with professional chefs. The final shot shows Optimus back in a casino at a roulette table.\n\nMusk has already shown Optimus folding laundry and walking in earlier demos. He continues to frame [humanoid robots]( as the solution for labor shortages tied to declining fertility rates.\n\nAn Optimus humanoid robot showcased at the Tesla booth at the 8th CIIE in Shanghai, China on Nov. 6, 2025.  (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nShortly after sharing the video, Musk spoke at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, where he argued that humanoid robots will reshape society. According to Musk, work will shift from a necessity to a hobby. He compared future jobs to gardening for fun rather than buying vegetables at a store.\n\nMusk said he expects money to lose relevance as [artificial intelligence]( and robotics advance. He also claimed humanoid robots will become the biggest product in history. In his view, there is one clear path to universal wealth. He said AI and robotics can eliminate poverty and allow people to choose work only when it brings joy.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered a more cautious perspective. He agreed that jobs will change but noted that currency will continue to matter for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Tesla Bot humanoid robot of Tesla \"\"Optimus\"\" is displayed at the 2023 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, China, July 6, 2023.

Robots that can cook, build and respond to emergencies could reshape our communities. They may also transform what people see as valuable work. Even if full robot integration is years away, companies like Tesla are already starting to show how quickly this tech can evolve. You may not see an Optimus on your street yet, but the direction is clear, and the pace is fast.\n\nThink your devices and data are truly protected?

After being left for dead in the AI race, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has doubled in 2025 as investors warm to a sweeping turnaround plan, a 9.9% U.S. government equity stake, and fresh partnerships with Nvidia, SoftBank – and potentially even Apple. [[1]](\n\nWith the share price recently around **$40.56** after a Black Friday surge of more than 10%, the obvious question for investors is: **where could Intel’s stock be trading by 2026?** [[2]](\n\nThis article pulls together the latest **news, analyst targets and algorithmic forecasts** to outline a grounded, data-backed **Intel stock price forecast for 2026** – and the key risks that could make or break that outlook.\n\n> **Important:** This is **not** investment advice. It’s informational and educational only. Always do your own research or consult a licensed financial adviser before investing.\n\n* **Price & performance:** Intel trades near **$40–41**, up roughly **100% year-to-date**, and close to new 52‑week highs (approx. $17.67–$42.48 range). [[3]](\n\n* **Q3 2025 results:** Revenue in Q3 2025 was **$13.7 billion**, up 3% year‑over‑year. GAAP EPS swung from a **loss of $3.88** a year ago to **profit of $0.90**, while non‑GAAP EPS hit $0.23, with a sharp recovery in gross margins. [[4]](\n\n* **Business mix:** Client computing (PC chips) grew 5% YoY to $8.5B, while Data Center & AI slipped 1% to $4.1B. Intel Foundry reported $4.2B in revenue and remains loss‑making but strategically crucial. [[5]](\n\nThese improving fundamentals, combined with highly visible political and strategic backing, set the stage for **2026 to be a “proof year”** for Intel’s turnaround – especially its foundry ambitions and AI roadmap.\n\nIn **August 2025**, Intel and the Trump administration agreed to convert CHIPS Act grants into an equity investment:\n\n* The U.S. government is investing **$8.9 billion** into Intel common stock as part of a broader **$11.1 billion** support package. [[6]](\n\n* The stake is about **9.9–10% of Intel’s shares**, structured as a passive ownership with no board representation. [[7]](\n\n* **Upside:** De facto government backstop for foundry investments and fabs, which could reduce bankruptcy or capital‑access risk and support a premium valuation if the strategy works. [[8]](\n\n* **Downside:** Political scrutiny over layoffs, offshoring and buybacks, plus the possibility of policy‑driven rather than purely profit‑driven decisions. Critics already argue the deal is a heavy-handed intervention in corporate governance. [[9]](\n\nBy 2026, markets will have a much clearer view of whether this “national champion” status is a valuation tailwind or a drag.\n\n* **Nvidia** agreed to invest **$5 billion in Intel stock** and co‑develop multiple generations of custom data‑center and PC CPUs with Nvidia’s NVLink and GPU technology integrated. [[10]](\n\n* **SoftBank Group** committed **$2 billion** for Intel shares at **$23 per share**, becoming one of Intel’s larger shareholders. [[11]](\n\nTogether with the U.S. stake, that’s roughly **$15+ billion in new equity capital** anchored by major strategic and financial players.\n\n* Signal that **AI hyperscalers and capital allocators believe Intel’s 18A and future nodes can be competitive**.\n\n* Bolster the balance sheet and reduce funding risk for Intel’s massive fab build‑out in Arizona, Ohio and elsewhere. [[12]](\n\n* Lay the groundwork for **multi‑year revenue ramps** in AI infrastructure, potentially becoming visible in earnings models by 2026.\n\nThe single biggest catalyst behind Intel’s recent Black Friday surge was a familiar name: **Apple**.\n\n* Supply‑chain analyst **Ming‑Chi Kuo** said the odds of Apple using Intel as an **advanced‑node supplier for M‑series chips** have “improved significantly”, with shipments possibly starting in **2027**. [[13]](\n\n* Kuo reports that Apple has a **non‑disclosure agreement** and is waiting on Intel’s **18A PDK 1.0/1.1**, expected in early 2026 – a key milestone in proving Intel’s process readiness. [[14]](\n\n* Intel stock jumped **over 10%** on the rumor, becoming the best‑performing stock in the S&P 500 on Black Friday. [[15]](\n\nIf Intel delivers stable 18A silicon and Apple signs on in 2026 for 2027 production, the market could start **pricing in multi‑billion‑dollar foundry revenues** long before chips ship. That’s a key part of bullish 2026 price targets.\n\nA widely circulated TradingNews analysis highlights comments by Elon Musk that Tesla “might do something with Intel,” fuelling speculation that Intel could produce future AI5 chips for robotaxis and robotics. [[16]](\n\nWhile no formal deal has been announced, the **Tesla rumor reinforces a broader narrative**: if Intel can win *any* large AI chip customers besides Nvidia and potential Apple work, its foundry could move toward break‑even **around late 2026**, a milestone several bullish models are baking in. [[17]](\n\nThe other big storyline heading into 2026 is **intensifying competition with TSMC** and the legal risk around talent moves.\n\n* TSMC has sued former senior executive **Wei‑Jen Lo**, who joined Intel in 2025, alleging breach of contract and potential leakage of trade secrets. Prosecutors in Taiwan have raided his homes and seized devices as part of a probe. [[18]](\n\n* Intel strongly denies any wrongdoing and stresses that it prohibits the transfer of confidential third‑party IP, backing Lo in internal memos. [[19]](\n\nThis case underscores the stakes: with Intel now backed by the U.S. government and vying to repatriate leading‑edge manufacturing, **any misstep on IP or export controls could trigger sanctions, fines or reputational damage**, affecting valuations in 2026.\n\n* **TradingView** aggregates a **12‑month consensus target around $38.30**, with a high of $52 and a low of $24. [[20]](\n\n* **Benzinga** reports a lower consensus target of **$31.20** from 32 analysts, again with a wide range from **$20 (bearish)** to **$52 (bullish)**. [[21]](\n\n* **MarketBeat** data cited in a recent feature notes an average target of about **$34.84**, with the Street‑high target at **$52**, well below the post‑rally spot price near $40–41. [[22]](\n\n* **Most analysts still model Intel in the mid‑30s**, implying *downside* from current levels.\n\n* A **smaller group of bulls** sees upside toward the low‑50s – roughly **25–30% above** recent prices – based on a successful turnaround and higher AI/foundry contribution by 2026. [[23]](\n\nSince these are **12‑month** targets set in late 2025, they effectively cover an investment horizon stretching well into **late 2026**, making them a good benchmark for “base‑case” expectations.\n\nBeyond human analysts, several services publish **model‑driven Intel price predictions** that explicitly extend into 2026. They often disagree sharply – a useful reminder of how uncertain the path is.\n\n* That implies only around **+4–5%** upside from the current ~$40.56 base, but allows for sizable swings. [[24]](\n\nThis sits broadly in line with **cautious Wall Street targets** and assumes a slow, steady re‑rating.\n\nCrypto‑style data platform **CoinCodex**, which also models stocks, paints a more pessimistic picture:\n\n* It expects Intel to **fall to about $23.61 in one year**, a drop of roughly 40% from current prices.\n\n* Its long‑term model indicates the **highest expected price by 2026 is around $45.34**, suggesting limited upside beyond the mid‑40s. [[25]](\n\nCoinCodex’s technical dashboard currently labels sentiment as **“bullish”** in the short term, but its longer‑term algorithm still flags Intel as “not a good stock to buy” based on projected declines. [[26]](\n\nAt the other extreme, **LongForecast** – which uses a proprietary quantitative model – projects Intel could trade in the **$70–$90+ range during parts of 2026**, with December 2026 levels around the low **$90s**. That would more than **double the current price**, but with large month‑to‑month volatility. [[27]](\n\nThese numbers are **far above most analyst targets**, and should be treated as a highly speculative scenario rather than consensus.\n\nA detailed 2025 analysis from TradingNews lays out one of the more concrete 2026 valuation frameworks:\n\n* It highlights Intel’s **doubling in 2025 to around $44**, Nvidia’s $5B stake, the U.S. government’s $8.9B investment, SoftBank’s $2B, and potential Tesla and Apple chip work. [[28]](\n\n* The authors argue this capital and partnership stack, combined with cost cuts and EPS recovery, justify a **12‑month target of $55–$60**.\n\nThis is a **clearly bullish scenario**, but it aligns with the idea that if Intel executes well, 2026 could see **a structural re‑rating** rather than just cyclical improvement.\n\nRegardless of which numerical forecast you prefer, **most models key off a similar set of fundamentals**. Here are the levers that will matter most to Intel’s stock price in 2026:\n\n* Intel’s Q3 2025 results emphasize the ramp of its **18A process** (and future 14A) across both CPUs and foundry customers, with Fab 52 in Arizona now fully operational. [[30]](\n\n* Apple’s and other potential customers’ decisions in **2026** will hinge on the maturity and power/performance of these nodes. Delays or yield issues could quickly undercut bullish forecasts.\n\n* Intel Foundry generated **$4.2 billion in revenue** last quarter but remains heavily loss‑making. [[31]](\n\n* Bearish or cautious models assume the foundry continues to **bleed billions**, forcing Intel either to absorb ongoing losses or restructure again.\n\n* The AI server market is enormous and still growing fast; Nvidia and Intel frame their collaboration as targeting a **$150 billion‑plus market**, with x86 CPUs playing a major role. [[32]](\n\n* The extent to which Intel captures this demand – vs. remaining a secondary supplier – will heavily influence **earnings power by 2026**.\n\n* Intel’s Client Computing Group is already growing again (+5% YoY in Q3), benefiting from AI PC refresh cycles and new **Panther Lake** architecture on 18A. [[33]](\n\n* If AI PCs become a real secular upgrade cycle through 2026, they can provide **steady, high‑margin cash flow** that supports foundry investments.\n\n* The combined **government, Nvidia and SoftBank equity stakes** bolster Intel’s capital position but also **increase share count** and entangle the company in political priorities. [[34]](\n\n* How markets feel about this by 2026 – as a safety net or as “government overhang” – will influence the valuation multiple.\n\nGiven the wide dispersion of forecasts, it helps to think in scenarios rather than single‑point predictions.\n\n* 18A proves competitive; early 14A roadmap looks credible.\n\n* Nvidia collaboration ramps; Intel lands at least one significant **additional AI or automotive customer** (e.g., Tesla or another hyperscaler). [[35]](\n\n* Foundry losses shrink sharply, and investors believe in a path to **$10–12B foundry revenue by 2027**. [[37]](\n\n* The market to award a more typical **15–18x earnings multiple** (ex‑foundry adjustments), which underpins the **$65–$70** type 2026 targets seen in bullish research. [[39]](\n\n* The turnaround continues, but more slowly than bulls hope.\n\n* AI and PC trends are positive, but Intel remains a **challenger** rather than a clear share‑gainer.\n\n* The foundry moves toward smaller losses, but break‑even slips beyond 2026.\n\n* **Low‑40s:** consistent with StockScan’s average 2026 forecast (~$42) and some conservative analyst targets. [[40]](\n\n* **High‑40s to low‑50s:** If sentiment stays constructive and 18A progress is visible, Intel could trade closer to the top end of consensus price‑target ranges (~$50–52). [[41]](\n\n* Yield or delay problems at 18A/14A cause **customer hesitation or cancellations**.\n\n* Macro or AI spending slows, hurting data‑center demand and making the foundry economics even worse.\n\nThis is closer to **CoinCodex’s one‑year forecast** of ~$23.61 and its view that Intel’s stock could struggle to hold current levels by late 2026. [[43]](\n\n1. **Execution risk:** Intel’s recent history is full of missed timelines. Any further slip in 18A or 14A would directly undermine the foundry strategy, analyst confidence and multiples. [[44]](\n\n2. **Geopolitical risk:** Intel sits at the heart of U.S.–China tech tensions and domestic industrial policy. Export controls, sanctions or policy shifts could affect both demand and cost structures. [[45]](\n\n3. **Legal/IP risk:** The TSMC lawsuit around Wei‑Jen Lo highlights how aggressively rivals will defend IP – and how sensitive regulators are to trade secrets in the chip sector. [[46]](\n\n4. **Government overhang:** With the U.S. government holding nearly 10% of Intel, future debates over layoffs, labor conditions, or offshoring could lead to **political interventions that markets dislike**. [[47]](\n\n5. **AI cycle normalization:** If AI infrastructure spending normalizes faster than expected, or if competitors like TSMC, Samsung, AMD or ARM‑based players erode Intel’s share more than models assume, 2026 revenue and margins could disappoint.\n\n+ The stock has already doubled in 2025 and now trades above many published 12‑month price targets. [[48]](\n\n+ Traditional analysts cluster around **mid‑30s to low‑40s** a year out, modestly below or just above current levels. [[49]](\n\n+ See Intel as a **leveraged AI and reshoring play**, where successful execution on 18A and foundry economics could justify **$65–$70** and beyond by 2026. [[50]](\n\n+ Highlight ongoing execution and dilution risk, with some algorithms projecting the stock back toward the **mid‑20s** or worse if the turnaround disappoints. [[51]](\n\n* The **2026 outcome band is unusually wide**, spanning from deep downside to substantial upside, and depends heavily on technical milestones and political decisions.\n\n* Position sizing, diversification, and time horizon are crucial: Intel may fit best as one piece of a broader **semiconductor or AI basket** rather than a single‑name bet – especially if your thesis is focused on 2026.\n\nAgain, this article is **not investment advice**. But if you’re watching Intel into 2026, the **numbers to watch** will be:\n\nThose will likely move the stock far more than any single algorithmic price prediction.\n\n1. [ 2. [ 3. [ 4. [ 5. [ 6.

He has been writing for around nine years now across the web and in print too. Connor has attended the biggest tech expos, including CES, MWC, and IFA -- with contributions as a judge on panels at them. He's also been interviewed as a technology expert on TV and radio by national news outlets including France24. Connor has experience with most major platforms, though does hold a place in his heart for macOS, iOS/iPadOS, electric vehicles, and smartphone tech. Just like everyone else around here, he's a fan of gadgets of all sorts. Aside from writing, Connor is involved in the startup and venture capital scene, which puts him at the front of new and exciting tech -- he is always on the lookout for innovative products.\n\nThe robot stands 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighs as much as a golden retriever and is nearly the price of a brand-new budget car. This is [Neo]( the [humanoid robot](/tech/computing/a-softer-humanoid-robot-for-the-home/).\n\nBilled as a personal assistant you can talk to and eventually rely on to handle everyday tasks, Neo could load your dishwasher and fold your laundry.\n\nBut it doesn't come cheap: It'll cost you $20,000. And even then, you'll still need to train this new home bot, and it possibly requires remote assistance as well.\n\nIf that still sounds enticing, preorders are now open (for $200 down). You'll be signing up as an early adopter for what Neo's maker, a California-based company called 1X, is calling a \"\"consumer-ready humanoid.\"\" That's opposed to other humanoids under development from the likes of [Tesla](/videos/analyzing-the-details-in-teslas-latest-optimus-robot-demo/) and [Figure](/tech/computing/ai-brains-in-a-humanoid-robot-meet-figure-02/), which are, for the moment at least, more focused on factory environments.\n\nNeo is a whole order of magnitude different from [robot vacuums](/home/kitchen-and-household/best-robot-vacuum/) like those from Roomba, Eufy and Ecovacs, and embodies a long-running sci-fi fantasy of robot maids and butlers [doing chores](/tech/services-and-software/ai-and-robots-that-do-your-household-chores-dream-on-folks/) and picking up after us. If this is the future, read on for more of what's in store.\n\n*Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.* [*Add CNET*]( *as a preferred Google source.*\n\nThe pitch from 1X is that Neo can do all manner of household chores: fold laundry, run a vacuum, tidy shelves and bring in the groceries. It can open doors, climb stairs and even act as a home entertainment system.\n\nNeo appears to move smoothly, with a soft, almost human-like gait, thanks to 1X's tendon-driven motor system that gives it gentle motion and impressive strength. The company says it can lift up to 154 pounds and carry 55 pounds, but it is quieter than a refrigerator. It's covered in soft materials and neutral colors, making it look less intimidating than metallic prototypes from other companies.\n\nThe company says Neo has a 4-hour runtime. Its hands are IP68-rated, meaning they're submersible in water. It can connect via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and 5G. For conversation, it has a built-in large language model (LLM), the same sort of [AI technology](/tech/services-and-software/best-ai-chatbots/) that powers [ChatGPT](/tech/services-and-software/what-is-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/) and [Gemini](/tech/services-and-software/what-is-gemini-everything-you-should-know-about-googles-ai-tool/).\n\nThe primary way to control the Neo robot will be by speaking to it, just as if it were a person.\n\nStill, Neo's usefulness today depends heavily on how you define useful. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern got an [up-close look at Neo]( at 1X's headquarters and found that, at least for now, it's largely teleoperated, meaning a human often operates it remotely using a [virtual-reality headset](/news/best-vr-headset-sem/) and controllers.\n\n\"\"I didn't see Neo do anything autonomously, although the company did share a video of Neo opening a door on its own,\"\" Stern wrote last week. 1X CEO Bernt Børnich reportedly told her that Neo will do most things autonomously in 2026, though he also acknowledged that the quality \"\"may lag at first.\"\"\n\nThe company's FAQ says that if there's a chore request Neo doesn't know how to accomplish, you can schedule an expert from 1X to help the robot \"\"learn while getting the job done.\"\"\n\nPart of what early adopters are signing up for is to allow Neo to learn from their environment, so that future versions can operate more independently.\n\nThat learning process raises questions about privacy and trust. The robot uses a mix of visual, audio and contextual intelligence -- meaning it can see, hear and remember interactions with you in your home.\n\n\"\"If you buy this product, it is because you're OK with that social contract,\"\" Børnich told the Journal. \"\"It's less about Neo instantly doing your chores and more about you helping Neo learn to do them safely and effectively.\"\"\n\nNeo's reliance on human operation behind the scenes prompted a response from John Carmack, a computer industry luminary known for his work with VR systems and the lead programmer of classic video games, including Doom and Quake.\n\n\"\"Companies selling the dream of autonomous household humanoid robots today would be better off embracing reality and selling 'remote operated household help',\"\" he wrote in a [post on the X social network](\n\n1X says it's taking steps to protect your privacy: Neo listens only when it recognizes it's being addressed, and its cameras will blur out humans. You can restrict Neo from entering or viewing specific areas of your home, and the robot will never be teleoperated without owner approval, the company says.\n\nBut inviting an AI-equipped humanoid to observe your home life isn't a small step.\n\nThe first units are expected to ship to customers in the US in 2026. There is a $499 monthly subscription alternative to the $20,000 full purchase price, although it will be available at an unspecified later date. A broader international rollout is promised for 2027.\n\nNeo's got a long road ahead of it to live up to the expectations set by Rosie the Robot in The Jetsons way back when. But this is no Hanna-Barbera cartoon. What we're seeing now is a much more tangible harbinger of change.\n\n* [M2 Mac Mini Review](/tech/computing/m2-mac-mini-2023-review-apple-adds-m2-and-m2-pro-chips-to-this-tiny-desktop/)\",0.7\ntesla,This Mining Stock Is Up 385% in 2025. 1 Reason This Could Be Just the Beginning. - AOL.com,https://www.aol.com/articles/mining-stock-385-2025-1-093500725.html,\"# This Mining Stock Is Up 385% in 2025. 1 Reason This Could Be Just the Beginning.\n\n* TNC The Metals Company is sitting on an extremely valuable reserve of polymetallic rocks.\n\n* The only thing holding it back is obtaining a license to start extracting these rocks from the deep sea.\n\nThe world wants more data centers and electric cars. To build them, it needs materials like copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese. Most of these metals come from mines that not only tear through forests and leave toxic tailings, but are also very expensive to build and maintain.\n\n**TMC The Metals Company** (NASDAQ: TMC) is pitching a different way to obtain these [metals]( In simple terms, it wants to vacuum rocks that contain these metals (\"\"nodules\"\") off the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n***Where to invest $1,000 right now?** Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the **10 best stocks** to buy right now.

For long-term investors, the underlying idea behind this company could be reason enough to buy this dip.\n\nImage source: The Metals Company.\n\nThe strongest argument supporting TMC's future growth is the combined net value of about $23.6 billion of the metals it expects to extract.\n\nIn August 2025, the company published two technical assessments that assigned that multibillion-dollar value to nodules in its exploratory area. Since the company is still only valued at about $2 billion, that project value gives its dreams some real economic backing.\n\nOn top of that, TMC ended its third quarter with about $115 million in cash, which should give a couple of years of runway with its current [cash burn rate](\n\nThe catch, of course, is that TMC does *not* have regulatory approval to mine the area under its exploratory control. Indeed, although it's been making progress on that front, the concrete steps needed to finally obtain that license are somewhat opaque at this moment.\n\nIf TMC can get through the regulatory process with a valid license to mine the seafloor for nodules, TMC's 385% gain so far in 2025 will be a prologue to something much bigger. Investors who are willing to make that bet could be rewarded, although be warned: This speculative stock will likely get bumpier until the road to mining is clear.\n\n## Should you invest $1,000 in TMC The Metals Company right now?\n\nThe *Motley Fool Stock Advisor* analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks]( for investors to buy now… and TMC The Metals Company wasn’t one of them.

What fuel use did we get?\n\nThe faux front skid plate distinguishes the plug-in version from the electric one.\n\nByUDI ETZION/WALLA!\",0.7\ntesla,Here's What Tesla's New Range of Affordable Electric Cars Cost - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/home/electric-vehicles/heres-what-teslas-new-range-of-affordable-electric-cars-cost/,\"What you get with the stripped-down Model Y and Model 3.\n\nTesla has launched a range of more affordable [electric cars](/home/electric-vehicles/best-ev-electric-car/) -- stripped-back versions of the [refreshed Model Y](/home/electric-vehicles/teslas-model-y-redesign-has-arrived-but-maybe-not-where-you-are/) and [Model 3](/home/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-3-refreshed-with-new-look-longer-range/). These pared-down EVs lower the starting cost, making it easier for more people to own a Tesla.\n\nThis change is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both cars, I see it as a move that could significantly boost Tesla ownership.\n\nThe idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by eliminating the extras that most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move.\n\nIt comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be seeking more affordable options. According to June figures from [Kelley Blue Book]( the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $49,077, while EVs cost $57,245 on average. That's lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about $10,500 higher than five years ago.\n\n## How much do Tesla's cheaper cars cost, and what do they come with?\n\nThe Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD.\n\nInside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, as well as textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and four-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen, eliminating the need for physical buttons.\n\nTesla includes a seven-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not.\n\n*Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.* [*Add CNET*]( *as a preferred Google source.*\n\nThe rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed internally with a fabric headliner for improved insulation, and the mirrors are manually folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter.\n\nThe Model Y Standard comes standard with 18-inch wheels, with 19-inch wheels available as an optional upgrade, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.\n\nMeanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.\n\nTesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation.\n\nIt retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.\n\nCharging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options.\n\nBoth cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.\n\n[Full Self-Driving]( is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance.\n\nI think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.\n\nIn my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet.\n\nPricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.\n\nFor now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.\n\nConnor is a technology writer and editor, with a byline on multiple platforms.

The new electric vehicle mileage charge, due from April 2028, was a focal point for organisations managing large car and van fleets.\n\nThe policy will see battery-electric vehicles taxed at 3p per mile and plug-in hybrids at 1.5p per mile.\n\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\n\nExperience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.\n\nPaul Hollick, Chair of the Association of Fleet Professionals ([AFP]( said fleets must now shape how the scheme is implemented. He warned that the charge “shouldn’t arrive in a form that could hamper electrification or cause any hesitation among potential business and private EV buyers,” adding that the AFP will play a central role in sector consultation.\n\nFrom a remarketing standpoint, Philip Nothard, Chair of the [Vehicle Remarketing Association]( said the arrival of road pricing is “no surprise,” but emphasised the need to ensure it does not damage consumer perception of EVs. Nothard said simplicity and clarity will be critical to maintaining demand for both new and used electric models.\n\nA number of operators expressed stronger concerns. Paul Holland, Managing Director for UK/ANZ Fleet at [Corpay]( said the new charge is “completely the wrong move at the wrong moment,” adding that businesses are being asked to “absorb even more pressure” while support for commercial EV adoption remains limited.\n\nDavid Bushnell, Director of Consultancy and Strategy at [Fleet Operations]( described the Budget as offering “little meaningful support for the electrification of transport,” warning that higher lifetime EV costs could reduce sales by hundreds of thousands and “destabilise used values.”\n\n# US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?\n\nDon’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.\n\nAlongside eVED, the reversal of the fuel duty freeze triggered further disquiet. Fuel duty will rise in stages from late 2026 before moving to RPI indexation.\n\nSimon Williams, Head of Policy at the RAC, said drivers will welcome the temporary continuance of the 5p cut, but that the relief will be “very short-lived” given the scheduled increases.\n\nThere were, however, positive reactions to several announcements.\n\nJohn Peters, Head of Consultancy at [Arval UK,]( said the £1.3 billion extension of the Electric Car Grant will “support business-need vehicles and salary sacrifice schemes,” helping offset any decline in EV demand caused by road pricing. Peters also welcomed the uplift in the Expensive Car Supplement threshold, saying it makes “many popular electric cars more accessible for fleets.”\n\nSuzanne (Sue) Robinson, Chief Executive of the [National Franchised Dealers Association]( similarly endorsed the ECS rise and said the grant extension could generate “an extra 130,000 electric car sales,” though she warned that pay-per-mile taxation “risks undermining consumer confidence at a critical moment.”\n\nDelays to Employee Car Ownership Scheme (ECOS) reforms until 2030 were also widely welcomed. James Tew, CEO at [iVendi]( said the postponement avoids immediate disruption to dealer recruitment and nearly-new stock supply.\n\n### Sign up for our daily news round-up!\n\n### Give your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\n\nThe gold standard of business intelligence.\n\nExperience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.\n\n#### Sign up for our daily news round-up!\n\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\n\nGive your business an edge with our leading industry insights.\n\n[View all newsletters]( from across the GlobalData Media network.\",0.7\ntesla,Petersen Museum's Newest Exhibit Showcases Iconic Off-Road Racers - Car and Driver,https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a69560711/petersen-museum-legends-of-the-dirt-exhibit/,\"**New!**Shop For Cars Available Near You.\n\nGot it!\n\nCalled 'Legends of the Dirt,' it includes a classic Bronco Baja winner and possibly the craziest Suzuki hatchback of all time.\n\n*   **There's a classic Bronco Baja winner, an Italian WRC legend, and possibly the craziest Suzuki hatchback of all time.**\n\nWhile the Petersen Automotive Museum is otherwise a glittering collection of gleaming sheetmetal on polished floors, its latest exhibition is all about getting mud on your boots. Dubbed \"\"Legends of the Dirt, the exhibit features some of the greatest off-road racing machines from the Baja 1000, King of the Hammers, and the World Rally Championship.\n\nFrom the latter, we have the 1983 Lancia Rally 037, the last rear-wheel-drive car to hold its own against the onslaught of all-wheel-drive machines in WRC racing. Driven by Finn Markku Alén and Walter Röhrl (perhaps better known for his exploits racing for Audi), this car won Lancia the Constructor's title in 1983. Every winning driver since then has been in an AWD machine.\n\nSpeaking of all-wheel drive, few machines are nuttier than the 1993 Suzuki Cultus Pikes Peak Special. You may remember this subcompact hatchback as the Suzuki Swift or Pontiac Firefly (or even the Geo Metro, as it was sold here), which ordinarily had front-wheel drive and no more than 100 hp. This example has almost eight times as much.\n\nRaced at the Pikes Peak International Hillclimb by the affable Nouhiro \"\"Monster\"\" Tajima—and by thousands of youngsters in _Gran Turismo 2_—this hugely winged hatchback makes its power through a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine mounted up front. And, also, a second turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine in the rear. That's a lot of motor for one little car, especially one that tips the scales at less than 2000 pounds.\n\nThe Petersen will also be featuring a number of significant off-road racing trucks, including the 1995 Herbst \"\"Landshark.\"\" A SCORE International Class 1 desert racer, this custom-built off-roader was a game changer when it arrived on the sands in the mid-1990s, a cross between a traditional buggy-style Baja racer and the toughness of a truck.\n\nOther Baja legends include the 1970 Bronco \"\"Big Oly\"\" as driven by Parnelli Jones to two consecutive Baja 1000 wins (1971 and 1972). It looks like a Bronco on the outside, but it's a custom tube chassis underneath with a partially composite body. Like any good dune racer, it loves to fly.\n\nOther notable examples on display include the first King of the Hammers-winning Ford Bronco Ultra4, a 2010 Coleworks rock bouncer made for extreme vertical climbing, and a Global Rallycross Volkswagen Beetle GRC. Alongside these will be a collection of historically significant off-road racing motorcycles, along with displays explaining how off-road tech works.\n\nThis is the first time the Petersen has really gone big into an off-roading display, so if you're a fan of low-flying Fords taking to the skies above the Baja peninsula, you're going to want to schedule a visit. The exhibit opens on December 7 and runs right through January 2027. And they won't even make you wipe your feet before they let you in.\n\n*   [![Image 16: Lancia Stratos front three quarter]( Petersen Exhibit Spotlights Wedge-Shaped Cars](\n\nBrendan McAleer is a freelance writer and photographer based in North Vancouver, B.C., Canada.

Today I found another one. Though, it actually launched a little before the Tesla one. It’s a new hub with 18 fast chargers for fleet vehicles. The [press release]( from Terawatt Infrastructure says the source of electricity is renewables. “Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session.”\n\nThe location is Rialto, California, about 56 miles east of Los Angeles. The new fleet charging hub provides:\n\n* 24/7 security with 360-degree cameras and gated access to protect vehicles, cargo, and drivers.\n\nFor people who might think this new site is just a one-off, Terawatt opened a similarly sized hub [in April]( “The private site, shared among multiple fleets, will house a total of 20 pull-through and bobtail DC fast charging stalls and boast a capacity of 7MW — enabling charging for up to 125 trucks per day.”\n\nBut let’s get back to the [Rialto hub]( “The Rialto site brings Terawatt’s vision of a connected, electrified network to life. It provides fast, reliable, and high-speed pull-through charging along an electric lane that runs from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles through Vernon and Commerce, culminating in Rialto. Our network enables companies to reduce emissions and run a variety of routes across a number of vehicle classes with the confidence of a dependable charging solution. EV fleets can now travel further, more cleanly, without slowing down their operations,” said Neha Palmer, CEO and co-founder of Terawatt.\n\nSolar power canopies generate electricity and don’t require vast amounts of land. They also provide shade and protection from precipitation.\n\nThere has been much good news about new EV charger installations lately, despite the loss of the federal EV incentives and a Trump administration that is anti-EV.\n\nUsing fully electric medium- and-heavy-duty freight trucks reduces harmful air pollution because they don’t burn diesel fuel or gasoline. There are some environmental benefits as well.\n\n* In the five-county region of Southern California, **119,200 workers** are employed in the EV industry, which is 43.4 percent of all statewide jobs (275,600) in the EV industry.\n\n* In California, the EV industry pays an average annual wage of $91,300, well above the average annual wage across all industries of $68,500.\n\n*Sign up for [CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries]( sign up for [our daily newsletter]( and [follow us on Google News](\n\n*Have a tip for CleanTechnica?

Some of them tapped into real anxieties, while others tell a very different story.\n\n* **The long-running “Rich Dad’s Prophecy” crash (2016):** Kiyosaki spent years warning investors that baby boomer retirements could potentially trigger the “biggest crash in history.”  By 2016, he argued that the collapse had begun, blaming China’s slowdown and “Fed insanity.” However, despite the [volatility]( that year, U.S. stocks finished higher, not in shambles as he predicted.\n\n* **The Covid crash that “would keep going” (April 2020):** In the height of the pandemic panic, he laid out that the crash was far from over, urging investors into gold, silver, and crypto. Instead, the S&P 500 ended up posting [nearly a 27% gain]( in 2021.\n\n* **The 2021–2022 “giant crash” and “everything crash”:** [He forecasted an October 2021 wipeout]( warning that stocks, real estate, and crypto could potentially collapse together. Stocks dipped modestly, but Bitcoin and silver dropped significantly more. Over the following year, markets continued to post stronger gains.\n\n* **Hyperbolic targets for gold, silver, and Bitcoin (2023–2025):** From $5,000 gold and $500,000 Bitcoin to gold at $25,000 and [Bitcoin near $1 million]( his calls continue to point northward.

[[1]](\n\nWith U.S. markets closed over the weekend, those levels are the reference point for **Monday, December 1, 2025**, when traders will decide whether Bloom Energy’s AI-fueled rally still has room to run — or is due for a painful reset.\n\n* **Last trade (weekend reference):** around **$109.24–110.99** per share, based on exchange and data vendor. [[2]](\n\n+ Mid-day, MarketBeat reported BE up **8.3%** with last trade at **$109.54** on roughly **7 million shares**, below its ~9.6 million average volume. [[4]](\n\n* **52‑week range:** about **$15.15–147.86**, underscoring how far the stock has run in 2025. [[5]](\n\n* **Volatility:** German analysts peg Bloom’s **beta around 3.4**, meaning the stock has moved more than three times as much as the broader market. [[7]](\n\n* Some weekend coverage even frames Bloom as a **“1,000% in a year”** winner and notes that its market cap has increased more than tenfold as investors chase AI power plays. [[10]](\n\nIn short: **BE is entering December as a high‑beta, high‑expectation momentum stock trading not far from triple‑digit levels that were unthinkable a year ago.**\n\nAt the heart of the move is an increasingly simple narrative: **“AI needs huge amounts of reliable power, and Bloom Energy can deliver it off‑grid.”**\n\n* In **October**, Bloom announced a **$5 billion strategic partnership with Brookfield** to build fuel‑cell‑powered “AI factories” — data centers designed to run partly or fully independent of strained electricity grids. [[11]](\n\n* German commentary highlights an additional **framework agreement with Oracle** to supply decentralized power to selected data centers, reinforcing Bloom’s positioning as an infrastructure partner to major tech names. [[12]](\n\nThese deals turned Bloom from a niche fuel‑cell manufacturer into a **headline AI energy play** almost overnight.\n\nBloom has told regulators and the trade press that it plans to **double annual production capacity to 2 GW by the end of 2026**, with the potential to scale existing facilities up to about **5 GW**, banking on sustained data-center demand. [[13]](\n\nThe company is leaning into a “**bring‑your‑own‑power**” trend: data centers securing their own generation rather than waiting years for grid connections, as described by CEO KR Sridhar and industry coverage. [[14]](\n\nThe fundamental backdrop that underpins the AI story is the **third-quarter 2025 earnings report**, released on **October 28**:\n\n* **GAAP EPS:** still a **loss of about $0.10 per share**, as stock‑based compensation and other non‑cash items weigh on the bottom line. [[19]](\n\nManagement emphasized that this was **Bloom’s fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue and positive operating cash flow**, explicitly tying growth to AI‑related demand and national‑security concerns over grid reliability. [[20]](\n\nThis mix of **explosive growth, improving margins and AI‑themed partnerships** is what fueled October’s breakout — and set the stage for the late‑November surge.\n\nThe period from **Friday, November 28 through Sunday, November 30** has been packed with news and commentary that will shape how traders approach BE at Monday’s open.\n\n* MarketBeat reported the stock **up 8.3% mid‑session**, hitting an intraday high near **$108.92** and last trading at **$109.54**, versus a prior close of **$101.14**. Volume near **7 million shares** was significant but actually below its recent average. [[21]](\n\n* Robinhood’s quote page shows a similar **day range of about $102.50–111.00**, with shares around **$110.84**, roughly **8.1% higher** on the day. [[22]](\n\n* U.S. trading-education sites described Bloom’s latest jump as yet another chapter in **“Bloom Energy’s surprise surge”**, tying the intraday spike directly to its record Q3 numbers and AI narrative. [[23]](\n\n* A German analysis highlighted that BE had **finally reclaimed the psychologically important $100 mark** and pointed to a **Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 92**, labeling the stock **“technically extremely overbought.”** [[24]](\n\n### 3.2 CFO and insider selling: A warning sign at the top?\n\nAlso on **November 28**, German outlet *Kapitalmarktexperten* reported that **CFO Aman Joshi** has filed a plan to sell **15,000 shares**, worth roughly **$1.5 million**, right after the stock more than doubled in under two months. [[25]](\n\n* The sale plan was disclosed in a **holiday‑week SEC filing**, just as the stock closed around **$101.14**, a one‑day gain of more than 7%. [[26]](\n\n* The article stresses that insider sales are common, but the **timing at the peak of the rally** could be interpreted as a caution flag.\n\n* It reiterates that Bloom’s **Q3 revenue grew 57% to $519 million**, but argues that the **valuation has run far ahead of fundamentals**, citing a **P/E above 500** and **RSI above 92**. [[27]](\n\n* Investing.com previously flagged November sales by director **Jim H. Snabe**, who sold **20,000 shares around $143** for about **$2.86 million**, close to the stock’s 52‑week highs. [[28]](\n\n* Another director, **Bush**, also sold about **$5.1 million** in stock earlier in November. [[29]](\n\nA weekend feature on a German news hub summed it up bluntly: insiders are **“seizing the opportunity to sell”** into AI‑driven euphoria. [[30]](\n\n* A **MarketBeat** filing alert on **November 28** showed **Ensign Peak Advisors** cut its Bloom stake by **84.5%** in Q2, selling about **352,100 shares** and leaving **64,667** shares. Other institutions like Mizuho and Comerica increased their holdings, and overall **institutional ownership stands around 77%**. [[31]](\n\n* On **October 31**, the company priced an **upsized $2.2 billion offering of 0% convertible senior notes due 2030**, up from an initially proposed $1.75 billion, with an option for another $300 million. [[32]](\n\n* The **initial conversion price of about $194.97 per share** represents a roughly **52.5% premium** to the October 30 closing price of $127.85. [[33]](\n\n* On one hand, it gives Bloom huge **growth capital with no cash interest**.\n\n* On the other, it adds **substantial potential dilution** and underscores how aggressively the market is valuing future growth — a key point in “bubble” arguments. [[34]](\n\n### 3.4 Weekend think‑pieces: AI jewel or classic bubble?\n\nThe tone of analysis over the weekend has been sharply divided.\n\n* A widely shared piece from *boerse‑global.de* (via ad‑hoc‑news) on **November 30** describes Bloom as a **“high‑flying gamble on AI’s power demand.”** It argues that the stock’s valuation has **“detached” from traditional metrics**, notes that **insiders are selling**, and points to **Bank of America’s target price more than 60% below the current level** as evidence of potential downside. [[35]](\n\n* The same article mentions **year‑to‑date gains of roughly 318%** and characterizes BE as a **“momentum trade”** driven by hype, possible **short squeeze dynamics**, and a powerful narrative about powering AI data centers — but warns that failure to convert partnerships into firm orders could trigger a sharp correction. [[36]](\n\n+ **>300% share price increase since the start of the year**.\n\n+ **P/E ratio around 562** and **price‑to‑sales near 13.15**, estimated to be almost **seven times the sector average**.\n\n+ Big price‑target hikes from **Morgan Stanley ($155)**, **HSBC ($150)**, **Susquehanna ($157)** and **JPMorgan ($129)**, but an **average analyst target near $94**, still below current prices. [[37]](\n\n* A Morningstar/MarketWatch‑syndicated column earlier in the autumn already framed Bloom as a name where it might be “time to sell after its AI‑fueled rally,” a theme echoed in the latest European editorials. [[39]](\n\n* A Yahoo Finance valuation piece earlier in November used a **discounted cash flow (DCF) model** to argue that despite intense volatility and a 24% monthly drop, Bloom could still be **undervalued by nearly 30%** relative to long‑term cash flow projections. [[40]](\n\n* Several trader‑focused sites on **November 28** framed Bloom’s surge as justified by its **record Q3 revenue, expanding margins and AI positioning**, drawing comparisons to prior early‑stage growth stories in EVs and alternative proteins while stressing the stock’s extreme volatility. [[41]](\n\nIn other words, the last three days have solidified Bloom Energy as **both a poster child of the AI‑power boom and a prime candidate for a momentum unwind**.\n\nOne of the most striking features of Bloom Energy right now is how **divided the forecasts are**.\n\n* **MarketWatch** lists an **average recommendation of “Overweight”** and an **average target price around $114.05** based on **27 analyst ratings**, implying only modest upside from current levels. [[42]](\n\n+ **Consensus rating: “Buy”**.\n\n+ **Average 12‑month target: $83.16**, which actually implies around **24% downside** from roughly $109.24.\n\n+ A **target range from $10 to $157**, underscoring the scale of disagreement on Bloom’s fair value. [[43]](\n\n* **Bank of America Securities (Julien Dumoulin‑Smith)** raised its target from **$26 to $39** on **November 25**, but kept an **“Underperform”** rating, calling Bloom one of the strongest AI‑themed performers yet still substantially overvalued. [[44]](\n\n+ **Morgan Stanley:** Overweight, target **$85 → $155**.\n\n+ **HSBC:** upgraded from Hold to **Strong Buy**, target **$100 → $150**.\n\n+ **Susquehanna:** Positive rating, target **$105 → $157**.\n\nThe net result: **headline ratings skew bullish**, but **high‑profile skeptics like BofA** — and some valuation sites — see substantial downside risk from current prices.\n\n* **SimplyWall.St** updated its narrative on **November 30**, nudging its **fair value estimate from about $111.85 to $112.50** and concluding that Bloom is only about **3% undervalued** at current prices — essentially “fairly valued” given the assumptions. [[46]](\n\n* A related SimplyWall.St note earlier in the week flagged Bloom as **around 9.6% undervalued**, with **90‑day returns over 80%** and a **three‑year total shareholder return around 375%**, but stressed the risk that such returns may not be sustainable. [[47]](\n\n* **Danelfin**, an AI‑driven ranking platform, assigns Bloom an **AI Score of 8/10 (Buy)**, estimating a **62.32% probability** that the stock will **outperform the S&P 500 over the next three months**, versus a baseline probability of 55.18% for the average U.S. stock — a roughly **7‑percentage‑point edge** in its framework. [[48]](\n\nThese figures feed into arguments that the stock is priced for near‑perfect execution.\n\nSome trading‑oriented sites even present **hypothetical short‑selling scenarios**, with one model suggesting a potential **18–19% one‑year return** on a short initiated at current levels — further evidence that **both bulls and bears see BE as a high‑conviction, high‑risk name.** [[51]](\n\nBehind the volatility and media noise, there is a **genuine growth story** that supports at least part of the rally.\n\n* **2025 revenue:** projected around **$1.90 billion**, up nearly **29%** from an estimated $1.47 billion in 2024.\n\n* **2026 revenue:** expected to rise to about **$2.42 billion**, another **27% jump**.\n\n* **EPS:** expected to climb from a **loss of $0.13 in 2024** to **$0.54 in 2025** and **$1.07 in 2026**, more than doubling in one year.\n\nThe Q3 numbers already show this trajectory starting to play out, with **non‑GAAP profitability** improving meaningfully even as the company continues to invest in capacity. [[53]](\n\n* They provide **long‑dated capital with no interest expense**, helping finance capacity expansion and large AI‑related projects. [[54]](\n\n* The **conversion price near $195** suggests bond investors are only protected if Bloom’s share price remains elevated, which some bulls interpret as a **vote of confidence in long‑term upside**.\n\nCritics, however, note that if Bloom’s valuation were to normalize, these notes could result in **significant dilution**, particularly if the share price oscillates around the conversion level later this decade. [[55]](\n\n* Utility Dive quotes Bloom’s CEO discussing how **data centers increasingly must “bring their own power”** to get online quickly, positioning fuel cells as a flexible alternative to open‑cycle gas turbines and grid upgrades. [[56]](\n\n* AI data‑center load projections for utilities like American Electric Power (AEP) and Brookfield’s growing AI strategy are repeatedly cited as core demand drivers for Bloom’s solutions. [[57]](\n\nFor long‑term growth investors, this **structural tailwind** is the central reason they’re willing to look past near‑term valuation extremes.\n\nThe same weekend coverage that celebrates Bloom’s growth story also underlines **significant risks** that will be on traders’ minds Monday morning.\n\n* With **P/E ratios north of 500**, **price‑to‑sales around 13** and **price‑to‑free‑cash‑flow above 150**, valuation‑focused analysts argue that **Bloom is priced for near‑flawless execution**. [[58]](\n\n* Bank of America’s **$39 target** implies about **60–65% downside** from current levels, a figure repeatedly quoted in European weekend coverage as a marker of “crash risk.” [[59]](\n\n* German and Austrian commentators explicitly use phrases like **“60% crash danger”** in their headlines when discussing Bloom’s recent move, underscoring how stretched some observers view the stock. [[60]](\n\n* While Bloom has announced **multi‑billion‑dollar partnerships**, many of these are **framework agreements** rather than fully contracted backlogs.\n\n* Analysts at BofA and others warn that the **40% annual megawatt growth** they model through 2028 requires **continued, large contract wins**, and that any slowdown could expose the stock to a brutal re‑rating. [[61]](\n\n* Utility Dive also notes that **competing technologies**, including conventional gas turbines and other firm power resources, could capture a large share of AI‑related load, even as Bloom positions itself as a key player. [[62]](\n\n* The **$2.2 billion convertible** is a powerful financing tool, but it adds **complexity to Bloom’s capital structure** and makes future EPS and share‑count outcomes harder to model. [[63]](\n\n* Ongoing **insider sales** — by the CFO and multiple board members — are being interpreted by some commentators as signals that insiders see the current valuation as an opportunity to de‑risk. [[64]](\n\n* Indicators like **RSI above 90**, a **beta over 3**, and the stock’s presence on lists of **top energy momentum names** show that sentiment may be **near a speculative extreme**. [[65]](\n\n* European commentary explicitly references **short‑squeeze dynamics** — shorts being forced to cover into strength — as a possible driver of recent moves, which can reverse quickly if momentum stalls. [[66]](\n\nAs BE returns to trading on **Monday, December 1**, several signposts will help investors and traders gauge the next phase of this story:\n\nMultiple analyses frame the recent move above **$100** as a key milestone. Oversold conditions or heavy profit‑taking could send the stock back toward that level, turning it into an important **support or breakdown zone**. [[67]](\n\nMarkets will be watching whether the disclosed **CFO sale plan** and ongoing insider sales trigger broader **profit‑taking**, or whether dip‑buyers step in, interpreting these moves as routine rather than ominous. [[68]](\n\n* If more firms move toward **BofA’s cautious stance**, the consensus target could drift lower, pressuring the stock. [[70]](\n\n* Conversely, **upgraded targets** closer to Morgan Stanley or Susquehanna’s upper‑100s would further legitimize the bull thesis. [[71]](\n\nAs of the last session, Bloom trades with **very high dollar volume** and is regularly featured on **“top energy stocks to watch”** lists, making it a playground for both institutional desks and short‑term traders. Expect **wide intraday swings** to persist. [[72]](\n\nHeading into the December 1, 2025 open, **Bloom Energy stock sits at the intersection of three powerful forces**:\n\n1. **A real, structural growth story** in AI‑driven data‑center power and distributed generation, backed by record revenue growth, improving margins and major infrastructure partnerships. [[73]](\n\n2. **Extreme valuation and speculative positioning**, with P/E and P/S multiples far above peers, insider selling at elevated prices, and technical signals screaming “overbought.” [[74]](\n\n3. **Deeply split forecasts**, from AI‑driven “Buy” models and double‑digit revenue growth projections to bank targets that imply more than 60% downside from current levels. [[75]](\n\nFor readers following BE into Monday’s session, the key question is less **“Is this a good company?”** and more **“How much of its future is already in the price?”**\n\nNothing in this article is financial advice, but the recent news flow makes one thing clear: **Bloom Energy is no longer a quiet clean‑tech stock — it’s a high‑velocity AI‑infrastructure bet where both upside and downside are amplified.**\n\n1.

In one Bay Area town, a terrible accident finally led to reform.\n\nA high school student on a high-powered electric vehicle known as an e-moto near Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, Calif.Credit...Balazs Gardi for The New York Times\n\nDavid Darlington is a lifelong cyclist who has received a National Magazine Award for public interest for a previous article on traffic laws and bike safety.\n\nIn September 2023,Amelia Stafford was 15 and beginning her sophomore year at Terra Linda High School in eastern Marin County, Calif. An honor student who loved reading, played the trumpet, did well at science and aspired to work for NASA, Amelia often rode her bike to school. Both of her parents — Monica, who works for the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, and Scot, an Emmy-winning composer and a founder of the Pollen Music Group — have histories as cyclists: He grew up riding to school in San Francisco, and she commuted to her job on her bicycle across the Golden Gate Bridge. “It was very important to me that my kids grow up learning how to ride bikes,” Scot says.\n\n“I wanted them to get exercise,” Monica adds, so Amelia’s bike didn’t have a motor. In the wake of the pandemic, electric bicycles were proliferating. Many of Amelia’s classmates had gotten e-bikes — or faster machines now known as e-motos — for birthdays and holidays. On a warm Saturday night after a football game, a group of kids was playing around with one.\n\nCoral Billisi, Amelia’s best friend, recalls that Amelia got on the bike behind someone and rode up and down the street. She says it was such a short ride that wearing a helmet didn’t occur to anyone. When the bike toppled over, “our immediate reaction was that we all started laughing — we just thought it was so funny,” she says. “Like, Ha ha, they’re so stupid, they can’t even ride bikes.”\n\nThen they saw the blood on the pavement around Amelia’s head.\n\nCoral, who had taken a CPR course, called 911 and told the others not to touch Amelia. Then she ran to the Staffords’ house and banged on the door.\n\nMonica had gone to bed early. She ran barefoot from the house. When she reached her daughter, Amelia’s eyes were open, but they had rolled back and blood was coming out of her ears. E.M.T.s arrived soon after and transported her to MarinHealth Medical Center, where a CT scan showed bleeding between the skull and the brain.\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to all of The Times.\",0.7\ntesla,Why do EV charging attempts fail?

These pared-down EVs lower the starting cost, making it easier for more people to own a Tesla.\n\nThis change is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both cars, I see it as a move that could significantly boost Tesla ownership.\n\nThe idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by eliminating the extras that most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move.\n\nIt comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be seeking more affordable options. According to June figures from [Kelley Blue Book]( the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $49,077, while EVs cost $57,245 on average. That's lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about $10,500 higher than five years ago.\n\n## How much do Tesla's cheaper cars cost, and what do they come with?\n\nThe Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD.\n\nInside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, as well as textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and four-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen, eliminating the need for physical buttons.\n\nTesla includes a seven-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not.\n\n*Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.* [*Add CNET*]( *as a preferred Google source.*\n\nThe rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed internally with a fabric headliner for improved insulation, and the mirrors are manually folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter.\n\nThe Model Y Standard comes standard with 18-inch wheels, with 19-inch wheels available as an optional upgrade, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.\n\nMeanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.\n\nTesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation.\n\nIt retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.\n\nCharging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options.\n\nBoth cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.\n\n[Full Self-Driving]( is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance.\n\nI think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.\n\nIn my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet.\n\nPricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.\n\nFor now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.\n\nConnor is a technology writer and editor, with a byline on multiple platforms.

Keep a keen eye on the Federal Reserve and tech.\n\n* Major stock indices gained, with S&P 500 ending near its 52-week high.\n\n* Market optimism was driven by Fed comments suggesting possible rate cuts and economic slowdown concerns.\n\n* An end-of-year rally may continue unless disrupted by major events or shocks.\n\nOut of nowhere, on a holiday week no less, it seemed the stock market got a bid.\n\nThe result was weekly gains for all the major averages. The Standard & Poor’s 500 ended about 1% below its 52-week high, and Eli Lilly ended the week still sporting a market capitalization of $1 trillion.\n\nIn the process, the pharmaceutical giant joined [Berkshire Hathaway]( as the only non-tech related companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more.\n\n* Can the stock market continue its bullish run?\n\n* What’s the outlook for December?\n\n* Can we start to hazard a guess about 2026?\n\nTheoretically, the run can continue its run this week and maybe into next week when the [Federal Reserve]( meets to discuss interest rates and the economy. The consensus (if the [CME]( Group’s FedWatch tool is an indicator) is a rate cut is probable.\n\nHawks push pause, doves seek cuts as traders mull rate-cut bet.\n\nJohn Williams, a key Fed official (because he’s president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank), said the risks of an economic slowdown were bigger than more [inflation]( So, interest rate could come down.\n\nMoreover, the [S&P 500]( (and the market generally) has just enjoyed five straight gains and ended Friday only 1% below its 6,920 all-time high reached on Oct. 29.\n\nWe should add the rally was basically prompted by Williams’ speech, given in Chile on Nov, 21.\n\nAs a result, something would have to derail the market. It would have to be an event: A shock runup in bond yields or oil prices, a terrorism attack, explosion in the Middle East or Ukraine, a sudden resignation no one expects.\n\nTJX Companies store brands are overcoming a major headwind.\n\nCould that mean the market could rally through to December as well? Maybe. There are only 22 trading days left in 2025. So, again, you need an abrupt, serious problem.\n\nThe market’s recent [pullback]( was set off by worries that Big Tech, especially Meta Platforms, Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla and Oracle, was investing too much money on artificial intelligence capacity. That is, huge data centers filled with racks of computers tied together with [AI]( chips.\n\nThat worry is probably still on many investors’ minds, but you won’t see it erupt again until the latter half of January when fourth-quarter earnings reports start.\n\nThis is not to deny the attention the recent market pullback received.  Through Nov. 20, the S&P 500 and fell 5.5% and the Nasdaq Composite fell more than 8% after hitting all-time highs on Oct. 29. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.5% from its all-time high, reached on Nov. 12.) The pullback was a surprise, and it actually did need a catalyst to calm investors.\n\nThe catalyst was John Williams’ speech.\n\nHis speech puts a floor under the market for now. And we wait for the Fed’s big event.\n\nGM is continuing to right size its EV production.\n\nNovember, normally one of the better months of the year, closed flat to modestly lower. [Nvidia]( was down 12.6%. Microsoft dropped 5%. Meta slipped 1%. Alphabet jumped almost 14%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow were basically flat. The Nasdaq and Nasdaq-100 Index each fell about 1.5%.\n\nThree interesting exceptions: Walmart jumped 9.2% in November. Berkshire Hathaway rose 7.6% as [Warren Buffett]( prepares to step down as CEO at the end of the month. [Costco]( Wholesale was up slightly, thanks to a 3.1% gain starting after Monday.\n\nAnd interest rates mostly moved lower anticipating the Fed’s Dec. 10 decision. The 10-year Treasury bond was yielding about 4% on Friday, down from 4.6% when 2025 opened. The 30-year mortgage rate is just above 6.2%, down from 7.25% in January.\n\n* The S&P 500 finished Friday up 16.45% for the year.\n\n* The Nasdaq is up 21% for 2025.\n\n* The Dow industrials are up 12.2%.\n\n* The Russell 2000 Index is up 12.1%.\n\nPart of the unease about the market in recent weeks has much to do with how the gains have been built.\n\nConsider the S&P 500. About 49% of its 38.6% total return since the market bottom in April 2025 (stock price gain plus [dividends]( came just from the Magnificent Seven stocks: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, according to S&P Senior Index analyst Howard Silverblatt.\n\nWhen asked, Silverblatt said he didn’t believe the S&P 500’s total return in any period was so dominated by such a small group of stocks.\n\nFor the year to date, the index is up 17.8% on a total return basis. Without the Mag Seven stocks, the total return falls to 10.24%.\n\nThe latest round of earnings reports is winding up with just 111 companies reporting quarterly results this week. Here are the key reports:\n\n* Credo Technology, maker of connectors for computer applications.\n\n* Database developer MongoDB.\n\n* Discount retailer DollarTree.\n\n* Three Canadian banking giants: Toronto Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\n\nTriple-digit growth meets Wall Street skepticism as Palantir battles AI bubble fears.\n\nCharley Blaine writes about stocks and financial markets, bonds and interest rates, oil and other commodities, and the economy.

That’s a steep drop from its original price for what is still a current and capable machine. With an 8-core CPU, a 10-core GPU, and Apple’s M2 chip inside, this MacBook handles most day-to-day tasks with ease. Web browsing, photo editing, app switching, and light video work all feel smooth and quick, and the 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display is bright at 500 nits, supports a wide P3 color gamut, and offers sharp resolution at 2880x1864. If you’ve been using a smaller screen or an older laptop, the difference is noticeable.\n\nThe M2 MacBook Air offers up to 18 hours of battery life for video playback or 15 hours for web use, so it’s built for long stretches without needing a charger, though your mileage may vary depending on use. The port selection includes MagSafe 3 for charging and two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, which cover most use cases but does mean you'll likely need adapters for more complex setups. The six-speaker system is surprisingly full for a laptop this size and supports Spatial Audio, which pairs well with the 1080p FaceTime camera and three-mic array for video calls. Bluetooth 5.3 and wifi 6 round out the connectivity, keeping everything modern. And while the 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD will suit general use, creatives or heavier users might prefer upgrading to the 512GB, 1TB, or even 2TB configurations, which are also discounted on StackSocial at the moment.\n\nSince it’s a pre-owned device, this unit comes with a Grade A refurbished rating, which means you’re getting something that may (or may not) have a few tiny scuffs, but nothing that affects performance. It also includes a 30-day parts and labor warranty, just in case. You won’t get macOS preinstalled in every case, but the device can be updated to the latest macOS Tahoe 26. If you want a larger MacBook with modern power but don’t want to spend over $1,000, this is [one of the more balanced deals you’ll find]( \"\"open in a new window\"\"), especially considering it’s less than half the price of a new 15-inch MacBook Pro.\n\n## How long do Cyber Monday deals really last?\n\nBlack Friday sales officially begin Friday, November 28, 2025, and run throughout “Cyber Week,” the five-day period that runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, December 1, 2025. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday dates have expanded as retailers compete for customers. Expect sales to wind down by December 3, 2025.\n\nWhat do you think so far?\n\n## What stores have the best sales on Cyber Monday?\n\nNowadays, both large retailers and small businesses compete for Cyber Monday shoppers, so you can expect practically every store to run sales through Monday, December 1, 2025. The “best” sales depend on your needs, but in general, the biggest discounts tend to come from larger retailers who can afford lower prices: think places like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot. You can find all the best sales from major retailers [on our live blog](\n\n## Are Cyber Monday deals worth it?\n\nIn short, yes, Cyber Monday still offers discounts that can be rare throughout the rest of the year. If there’s something you want to buy, or you’re shopping for gifts, it’s a good time to look for discounts on what you need, especially [tech sales]( [home improvement supplies]( and [fitness tech]( Of course, if you need to save money, the best way to save is to not buy anything.\n\n## Are Cyber Monday deals better than Black Friday?\n\nBlack Friday used to be bigger for major retailers and more expensive tech and appliances, while Cyber Monday was for cheaper tech and gave smaller businesses a chance to compete online. Nowadays, though, distinction is almost meaningless. Every major retailer will offer sales on both days, and the smart move is to know what you want, use price trackers or refer to [guides like our live blog]( that use price trackers for you, and don’t stress over finding the perfect timing.\n\n[Apple AirPods Pro 3 Noise Cancelling Heart Rate Wireless Earbuds]( \"\"(opens in a new window)\"\")   — $219.99  (List Price $249.00)\n\n[Apple iPad 11\"\" A16 128GB Wi-Fi Tablet (Silver, 2025 Release)]( \"\"(opens in a new window)\"\")   — $274.00  (List Price $349.00)\n\n[Dell 14 Premium DA14250 (Intel Core Ultra 7 255H, 512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, 2K Display)]( \"\"(opens in a new window)\"\")   — $999.99  (List Price $1,549.99)\n\n[Blink Outdoor 4 1080p Wireless Security Camera (5-Pack)]( \"\"(opens in a new window)\"\")   — $159.99  (List Price $399.99)\n\n[Shark AI Ultra Matrix Clean Mapping Voice Control Robot Vacuum with XL Self-Empty Base]( \"\"(opens in a new window)\"\")   — $249.99  (List Price $599.00)\n\n[Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm, S/M Black Sport Band)]( \"\"(opens in a new window)\"\")   — $339.00  (List Price $399.00)\n\n[WD 6TB My Passport USB 3.0 Portable External Hard Drive]( \"\"(opens in a new window)\"\")   — $138.65  (List Price $179.99)\n\n[Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 10.9\"\" 64GB Wi-Fi Tablet (Graphite)]( \"\"(opens in a new window)\"\")   — $139.99  (List Price $219.99)\n\nGet all the best deals and biggest sales curated by Daniel and the team.\n\nAdd to Cart Newsletter Shop smarter, save more money.

However, many corridors remain stalled by a 'feasibility wall' created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels.\n\nThere are now over 300 stakeholders involved in green corridors, up from 240 in the previous edition. Port authorities continue to be key leaders, with public sector and governmental actors following closely behind them. The vessel owner/operator category increased by over 30% since last year, which could indicate that port and government-led initiatives are having more success finding partners in shipping. The one category with no positive movement on the stakeholder side is financial institutions. This could be due to engagement with financiers occurring outside the core green corridor consortia.\n\nThis year’s findings also reveal that some government-funded initiatives have stalled after feasibility studies have been completed, suggesting a gap between government priorities and industry interests. While companies have leveraged government funding to explore fuel options and thereby reduce their in-house research costs, this has not yielded action in many cases. In contrast, initiatives with high industry involvement have been progressing the fastest, as indicated by the four green corridors now in the realization stage.\n\nOut of the 84 initiatives in this year’s edition, 24 are in the Initiation stage, 44 (16 early and 28 advanced) are in Exploration, 12 are in Preparation, and four are in Realization. Additionally, one-third of last year’s 59 initiatives have progressed between or within stages while the other two-thirds have maintained their progress status.\n\n“We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted,” said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonization at the Global Maritime Forum. “That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages, generate learnings that can influence the IMO’s reward mechanism, and put participants first in line for future global rewards.

CleanTechnica,https://cleantechnica.com/2025/11/30/the-strange-time-compression-of-sodium-ion-battery-development/,\"If you are not aware of Chinese battery technical leadership, it is probably time to take notice. As of 2025, [CATL and BYD]( have over 50% of the world’s EV battery market share. From January to September, they accounted for 811.7 GWh. CATL and BYD are not the only battery companies in China. In total, China EV [battery production]( hit 1,122 GWh over the same period, up 44% from the previous year.\n\nWhile the two giants have specialized in LFP and NMC batteries, relatively small Beijing HiNa concentrated on sodium-ion batteries (SIB) used in [JAC]( cars and in other areas, including [utility storage](\n\nHiNa’s inroads have made waves and reverberated throughout the industry. Competition is strong. Sodium-ion batteries have been under development for many years, with a field of competitors globally. [HiNa]( was founded in 2017, and produced sodium-ion batteries from its GWh class factory since November 29, 2022. What is interesting here is that HiNa seems to be lighting a fire under the competitors. HiNa introduced sodium-ion to the utility storage market, providing product for the world’s largest sodium-ion storage system ([a 100 MWh system]( in Nanning, Hubei, in July of 2024, the first stage of a planned 200 MWh system.\n\nThe two largest players are not standing still. BYD broke ground on construction of a 30 GWh sodium-ion factory in January of 2024 and announced sodium-ion products. BYD announced its [MC Cube-SIB]( product, a containerized battery energy storage unit for the utility storage market. BYD has claimed that its system could reduce costs below the HiNa system costs of [$ 0.03/kWh]( CATL’s first-generation sodium-ion battery was released in 2021, at 160 Wh/kg. Late this year, CATL announced the [Naxtra]( battery, with 175 Wh/kg and 10,000 cycle life, with operation from -40°C to 70°C and 90% energy retention at -40°C, offering 500 km (310 miles) of range.\n\nWhile Chinese battery companies announce and ship products, sources claim sodium-ion batteries need further development to compete with LFP. A [Stanford analysis]( early this year of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) stated that energy density was lower than lithium competitors and would restrain advancement without research breakthroughs. This analysis was picked up and amplified on [social media]( The social media source has an excellent description of SIB operation and technical details, some of which are from SIB researcher and expert [Shirley Meng]( While the warnings of other social media overheated claims are real, CATL Naxtra SIB, BYD MC Cube-SIB, and HiNa Haixing commercial battery announcements seem to contradict the slower rollout expectations. By some measures, those products meet [parity]( [with LFP]( The SIB products are there and perform well compared to LFP, with similar gravimetric energy density and cycle life, but lower volumetric density. However, SIB has superior energy retention at cold temperatures. The expectation in other quarters is that SIB will start to replace LFP. The question remains how much SIB will be produced and when.\n\nWhile the social media fracas has created a flurry of SIB interest and some hype, the real question is what happens next. With considerable investment in sodium-ion battery factories and new product, there is pressure to sell product. Sources agree that the initial best fit for the technology is grid storage, where density is not a factor. There is motivation to build production volume and use that to lower cost.\n\nThe pressure of sodium ion advancement is starting to be felt globally. In Korea, the warning is that battery companies there could lose market share if they do not adopt [sodium]( technology. [LG Chem]( has partnered with Sinopec to develop sodium-ion batteries. Korean battery companies rely heavily on NMC. The BYD Blade battery system showed that LFP can compete with NMC in EVs because it can fit more densely in battery packs, making up some of the difference with NMC. Because of this, LFP batteries are now appearing in some western cars like the [Chevy]( [Bolt]( and recently were in entry-level Teslas. Now SIB are expected to further undercut LFP prices, spurring the two largest battery companies to advance SIB and LG Chem to develop SIBs.\n\nAt the very least, the word in China is that in 2027, the [cost]( of SIB is expected to move toward $0.04/kWh prices typical of LFP. Given lower SIB material and production costs, when that happens, no one will want to be left behind as the inevitable shift to SIB becomes evident.\n\nThe natural progression of battery developments is that at first, only one of a few chemistries can meet application demands, then after the first chemistry does so, later on other lower cost, lower performance chemistries continually advance until they meet minimum requirements. When that happens, the leading chemistry moves up to a higher cost tier with more stringent applications.\n\nThis has happened several times before in EVs, with NCA replaced by NMC, and NMC now by LFP, each supplanting the other at lower costs as the newer entrants advance, meet threshold requirements, and get closer to theoretical performance. While lithium has been dominant for more than a decade, advancements in other chemistries have been expected for many years, with pressure on for lower costs, better low-temperature performance, and safety. Because of the nature of development and application needs at threshold requirements, advancements tend to go unnoticed until threshold requirements are reached. So it was with solar as well, where for many years, it was always too expensive. Then suddenly it wasn’t. It quickly passed parity with fossil fuel generation, and only hydro is cheaper now. The pace in battery chemistry advancements appears slower than semiconductors or solar, but it is steady, and with the level of volume and capital involved now, the necessary investment in research is now producing fruit.\n\nYou can be sure further advances will take place, and each step in advancement causes changes in application. Lithium has opened the market for EVs and grid storage. SIB will push open the market for long-distance electric ships and all ships in general. SIBs will bring electrification market penetration to new levels and new large-scale application, with costs that will sweep away remaining questions of renewable economics and add further pressure to car companies to switch to EVs, cementing batteries as the lowest cost choice. The signs that ICE (internal combustion engine) parity is reached are apparent, with the auto companies waving a [white flag]( pleading for tariffs building an artificial moat against change that will inevitably succumb to progress. Their calls for protectionism belie years of EV development neglect. The changes already happening with solar, wind, and EVs will quicken pace and the cycle will repeat as further market adoption leads to further investment in cleantech. The economic excuses are melting away as the losers clinging to fossil fuels get left behind.\n\n*Sign up for [CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries]( sign up for [our daily newsletter]( and [follow us on Google News](\n\n*Have a tip for CleanTechnica?

Tianqi doesn’t rule out filing for international arbitration, he said.\n\nTianqi’s [fight for a say]( in a transaction involving one of the world’s biggest and most profitable lithium operations has endured [a series of setbacks in Chile]( with authorities there clearing the deal to go through with just boardroom approval. Last week the Chinese firm, which owns 22% of SQM, filed an appeal with Chile’s supreme court.\n\n“This is a matter of corporate governance standards,” Ha wrote. “This is unrelated to the identity of the partner.”\n\nThe SQM-Codelco partnership is a pillar of Chilean President [Gabriel Boric’s agenda]( to have more state control in key lithium assets while boosting output in the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nThe deal marks Codelco’s entry into lithium production, with the state company set to own 50% of shares plus one after 2030. Until then, SQM will retain operational control.\n\nEarlier this month, China’s antitrust agency [granted conditional approval]( for the partnership, saying the companies must honor existing commercial commitments and continue supplying Chinese customers on a “fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory” basis.\n\nTianqi’s Ha said SQM’s stake remains an important investment and that no decision had been made with regards to its sale.\n\n“Any future decisions will be based on comprehensive financial, legal, and other considerations, fully taking into account the interests of shareholders and stakeholders,” he wrote.\n\nExecuting a transaction that changes control of a listed company’s major asset without shareholder approval “sets a precedent that all international investors must take seriously,” Ha wrote. Tianqi remains confident that “Chile has the capacity to strengthen and maintain the governance standards.”\n\nNo comments found.\n\n[The Canadian miner said on Monday it had reached an agreement with Mali's government to resolve all disputes.](\n\n## Your Rankings.\n\nThe new Mining Power Rankings are live.

These pared-down EVs lower the starting cost, making it easier for more people to own a Tesla.\n\nThis change is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both cars, I see it as a move that could significantly boost Tesla ownership.\n\nThe idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by eliminating the extras that most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move.\n\nIt comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be seeking more affordable options. According to June figures from [Kelley Blue Book]( the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $49,077, while EVs cost $57,245 on average. That's lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about $10,500 higher than five years ago.\n\n## How much do Tesla's cheaper cars cost, and what do they come with?\n\nThe Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD.\n\nInside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, as well as textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and four-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen, eliminating the need for physical buttons.\n\nTesla includes a seven-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not.\n\n*Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.* [*Add CNET*]( *as a preferred Google source.*\n\nThe rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed internally with a fabric headliner for improved insulation, and the mirrors are manually folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter.\n\nThe Model Y Standard comes standard with 18-inch wheels, with 19-inch wheels available as an optional upgrade, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.\n\nMeanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.\n\nTesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation.\n\nIt retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.\n\nCharging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options.\n\nBoth cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.\n\n[Full Self-Driving]( is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance.\n\nI think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.\n\nIn my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet.\n\nPricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.\n\nFor now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.\n\nConnor is a technology writer and editor, with a byline on multiple platforms.

As of Sunday, November 30, most of the roughly 6,000 affected aircraft are back in service, and fears of a full‑blown holiday travel meltdown have largely eased.  [[1]](\n\nThe emergency recall was triggered by an October 30 incident in which a JetBlue A320 flying from Cancún to Newark suddenly pitched down without pilot command, injuring passengers and forcing an emergency diversion to Tampa. Investigators later traced the problem to a software update in a key flight‑control computer that appears vulnerable to “bit flips” caused by intense bursts of solar energy.  [[2]](\n\n* **Scale:** About **6,000 A320‑family jets** – a little over half the global fleet – were flagged for urgent checks and fixes.  [[3]](\n\n* **Root cause:** A recent software update to the **elevator aileron computer (ELAC)** created a rare vulnerability where **intense solar radiation** can corrupt critical flight‑control data.  [[4]](\n\n* **Regulatory response:** Europe’s aviation regulator **EASA** issued an **Emergency Airworthiness Directive (AD 2025‑0268‑E)** on November 28, mandating repairs before affected aircraft carry passengers again.  [[5]](\n\n* **Fix strategy:** Around **5,100 jets** simply reverted to an earlier software version; about **900 older aircraft** need flight‑computer hardware changes, which take longer.  [[6]](\n\n* **Disruption:** Hundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed worldwide, with **Asia‑Pacific and Latin America** hit hardest, but major hubs avoided gridlock and US Thanksgiving traffic largely held up.  [[7]](\n\n* **Industry impact:** Analysts estimate **$2–3 billion in lost revenue for airlines**, while Airbus shares dipped on safety and cost concerns but so far face nothing like a 737 MAX‑style crisis.  [[8]](\n\n## What triggered the Airbus A320 software recall?\n\nThe crisis traces back to **October 30, 2025**, when a JetBlue A320 en route from Cancún to Newark suffered a sudden, uncommanded nose‑down maneuver at cruise altitude. The pilots recovered control and diverted to **Tampa, Florida**, where at least 10–15 passengers were treated for injuries from the abrupt descent.  [[9]](\n\nEarly analysis suggested the aircraft’s **elevator aileron computer (ELAC)** – the system that translates pilots’ side‑stick inputs into movements of the elevators and ailerons, controlling the jet’s pitch and roll – had briefly acted on corrupted data.  [[10]](\n\nAirbus later told airlines and regulators that a **recent ELAC software update**, originally designed to bolster protections against loss‑of‑control events, may have inadvertently opened a tiny but serious window where **“intense” solar radiation**can flip bits in the computer’s memory at just the wrong moment.  [[11]](\n\nThis kind of phenomenon – known in avionics and chip engineering as a **single‑event upset** – isn’t new. Modern aircraft are designed with extensive redundancy and safety margins to cope with cosmic rays and solar storms. What’s new here is that the specific software logic introduced earlier this year appears to have made one of those ultra‑rare bit flips capable of generating an **uncommanded flight‑control input**.\n\nOnce that risk was identified, Airbus issued an **Alert Operators Transmission (AOT)** and worked with EASA to turn it into a **legally binding Emergency Airworthiness Directive** requiring operators to apply fixes before their next passenger flight.  [[12]](\n\n## How many jets are affected – and where?\n\nThe A320 family – including the older **A320ceo** and the newer **A320neo** variants – is the **world’s most widely used single‑aisle jet**, the backbone of short‑ and medium‑haul flying from low‑cost carriers to legacy giants.  [[13]](\n\n* About **6,000 aircraft** worldwide needed checks and updates, roughly **half the active A320 fleet**.  [[14]](\n\n* The affected aircraft are spread across **Europe, North America, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Oceania**, operated by hundreds of airlines from budget carriers to flagships.  [[15]](\n\n* In **Japan**, ANA cancelled **around 95 domestic flights**, affecting more than **13,000 passengers**, as it worked through software updates on 34 A320‑series jets.  [[16]](\n\n* **Colombia’s Avianca** says about **70% of its fleet** is impacted; it has **halted ticket sales until December 8** and warned of significant disruption for at least ten days.  [[17]](\n\n* In **Australia and New Zealand**, Jetstar cancelled about **90 flights** on Saturday alone, while Air New Zealand dropped **27 flights** as they completed updates; both expect normal schedules to resume early this week.  [[18]](\n\nIn **India**, up to **200–250 A320‑family aircraft** across IndiGo, Air India and others were flagged. However, IndiGo reports that mandatory updates have already been completed on most of its affected fleet, with minimal cancellations.  [[19]](\n\nDespite alarm about potential chaos over **US Thanksgiving weekend**, the impact in North America has been relatively modest:\n\n* **American, Delta and United** all reported that they either completed or nearly completed the required fixes without major schedule changes.  [[20]](\n\n* The main exception has been **JetBlue**, which operates a heavily Airbus‑based fleet and had to cancel roughly **70 flights** as it cycled aircraft through updates.  [[21]](\n\nIn Europe, carriers such as **Lufthansa** and **easyJet** say most updates were completed overnight with only isolated delays, rather than mass cancellations.  [[22]](\n\n## What exactly went wrong in the A320 software?\n\nOn a modern Airbus, the pilot’s movements on the **side‑stick** don’t directly move cables and pulleys. They’re turned into digital commands, processed by a set of redundant computers (including the **elevator aileron computers**) which then drive actuators on the control surfaces.\n\n1. **Monitors sensor inputs** such as angle‑of‑attack (AoA) and pitch rate.\n\n2. **Cross‑checks data** between multiple channels to detect anomalies.\n\n3. **Applies automatic protections** – for example, avoiding a stall by pushing the nose down if it believes the aircraft is at too high an angle of attack.  [[23]](\n\nAccording to FlightGlobal and other specialist outlets, the software revision was meant to enhance protection against loss‑of‑control events – but under a narrow set of conditions, a solar‑induced bit flip can cause the system to misinterpret data and briefly command a **nose‑down input the pilots did not request**.  [[24]](\n\n* **Revert to the prior, proven software version** that does not contain the vulnerable logic.\n\n* Run checks to confirm the ELAC hardware is functioning properly.\n\nThis is typically a **2–3 hour job per aircraft**, often performed overnight or in off‑peak windows.  [[25]](\n\nHowever, around **900 older A320‑family jets** use a generation of computers that require **physical hardware replacement** rather than just a software rollback. Those aircraft face longer outages measured in days, not hours, and are driving much of the lingering disruption in markets such as Latin America and parts of Asia.  [[26]](\n\nOnce EASA’s emergency directive became effective on **November 29**, airlines faced a harsh requirement: **no passenger flights on affected A320s until the fix is in**.  [[27]](\n\n* **Pre‑cancelling** a block of flights to free up maintenance slots.\n\n* **Reassigning other aircraft types** (such as Boeing 737s or wide‑body jets) to cover the most critical routes.\n\n* Many major hubs were reporting **near‑normal traffic flows**, with delays measured in minutes rather than hours.  [[29]](\n\n* Airbus said airlines had made “rapid progress” and reiterated that safety was the overriding priority, even as it apologized for the disruption.  [[30]](\n\nSmaller and more regionally concentrated airlines, especially those with fleets heavily skewed toward older A320s, have had less flexibility:\n\n* **Avianca**, as noted, has suspended ticket sales for over a week and expects **ongoing disruption** as it cycles aircraft through hardware changes.  [[31]](\n\n* Some **Philippine and Indian carriers** have grounded dozens of flights while updates are completed, offering refunds and free rebooking.  [[32]](\n\nThis uneven impact highlights a structural divide: global network giants can shuffle aircraft types and spare capacity; smaller or low‑cost carriers that bet heavily on a single family – often the A320 – have fewer levers to pull when the unexpected happens.\n\n## Are A320s safe to fly now?\n\nFor passengers, the most important point is that **regulators are not allowing unfixed aircraft to carry paying customers**. The EASA directive and parallel actions by other authorities require operators to verify that each aircraft’s ELAC meets the new safety standard before it returns to service.  [[33]](\n\n* The underlying risk **remains extremely rare**; it appears tied to a combination of a specific software logic path and unusual bursts of solar activity.  [[34]](\n\n* Affected jets are either **grounded for modification** or have already had the fix applied. Airlines have strong incentives – regulatory, reputational and financial – to take this directive seriously.  [[35]](\n\n* Airbus and regulators continue to investigate the JetBlue incident and other data to understand whether additional long‑term software or hardware changes will be needed.  [[36]](\n\nFor travelers booked in the coming days, the practical advice is simple: **monitor your flight status closely** and expect occasional last‑minute aircraft swaps or minor delays, especially on carriers that rely heavily on older A320s.\n\nEarly estimates suggest airlines could absorb **$2–3 billion in lost revenue and extra costs**, including cancellations, rebookings, crew and maintenance overtime, and passenger compensation where applicable.  [[37]](\n\n* **Airbus shares fell** after the recall became public, as investors weighed potential liability, retrofit costs and reputational damage.  [[38]](\n\n* However, analysts note that this episode looks more like a **short, intense operational shock** than a multi‑year grounding. Unlike Boeing’s 737 MAX crisis, regulators have not stopped the A320 family from flying once fixes are verified.  [[39]](\n\nSeveral investor notes also highlight that Airbus reacted **quickly and transparently**, coordinating closely with EASA and airlines rather than disputing or downplaying the issue – a factor that may limit long‑term damage to the brand.\n\n* The A320 family recently **overtook the Boeing 737 as the industry’s most‑delivered jet**, cementing Airbus’s dominance in single‑aisle orders.  [[40]](\n\n* Any prolonged perception of software fragility could give Boeing a narrative opening – but only if Airbus’s fix falters, which there’s no evidence of so far.\n\nAnalysts are split: some see the incident as a **manageable stumble** in an otherwise strong program; others think it underscores the risks of ever more complex avionics in an era of rising solar activity and digital dependency.  [[41]](\n\n* Detailed investigation reports from **EASA, the US NTSB and other authorities** on the JetBlue incident and the broader fleet risk.  [[42]](\n\n* Potential **refinements to certification standards** for flight‑critical software, especially around resilience to **single‑event upsets** and extreme solar weather.  [[43]](\n\n* Additional **service bulletins** from Airbus as it implements permanent software redesigns beyond the emergency rollback deployed this weekend.  [[44]](\n\nThis episode is also a timely reminder that commercial aviation doesn’t operate in a vacuum – it operates under the Sun, during a period of heightened solar activity:\n\n* We are currently near the **peak of Solar Cycle 25**, when solar flares and coronal mass ejections are more common, increasing radiation exposure at flight altitudes.  [[45]](\n\n* As aircraft become more software‑defined and interconnected, **radiation‑hardening, redundancy and error‑correction** will only grow in importance for avionics design.\n\nIn that sense, the A320 recall may prove to be a **wake‑up call rather than a catastrophe**: a costly, disruptive reminder that even mature, widely trusted aircraft families must constantly be retested against new edge‑cases in our increasingly digital, and occasionally unpredictable, sky.\n\n* **Check your flight status** regularly over the next few days, especially with airlines that are heavy A320 operators.\n\n* If your flight is cancelled due to aircraft availability, you’re generally entitled to **rebooking or a refund**, and in some jurisdictions, compensation – check your local rules.  [[46]](\n\n* There is currently **no indication** that fixed aircraft are unsafe; the recall exists precisely to ensure that only compliant jets are flying.\n\nFor now, the story of the A320 software glitch is less “global aviation shutdown” and more “high‑stakes weekend sprint” – with thousands of engineers quietly winning the race against a rare, solar‑powered bug before most travelers ever noticed.\n\n1.

Norris struggled to match his team-mate, and at times it looked as if he was being overly cautious throughout the weekend. Sunday turned out to be particularly challenging for the Briton – and not only because of [McLaren]( strategy error. He lacked pace himself and failed to even reach the podium.\n\nBoth championship rivals not only kept their chances alive but closed the gap, and Norris’ advantage over Verstappen is now far from comfortable.\n\nThe Dutchman and Red Bull, for their part, capitalised on yet another mistake from rivals to win another race, already fifth since the summer break.\n\nPiastri’s dreadful run has finally ended – and just at the right moment to keep his championship hopes alive. Having lost a huge lead and slipped behind his team-mate in the standings, the Australian arrived in Qatar level on points with Verstappen, who only a couple of months ago was more than 100 behind him.\n\nQatar has always suited Piastri – he has been quick at Losail since his rookie season – and those who expected a comeback were proven right. Piastri was the quicker of the two McLaren drivers throughout the weekend, and he finally started clawing back the points he lost relative to Norris on Saturday by winning the sprint from pole.\n\nNot so long ago, after the Mexico Grand Prix, Ferrari was in second in the constructors’ championship.\n\nSince then, the Scuderia’s form has been nothing short of catastrophic. It has scored just 26 points in three grands prix, as many as Williams.\n\nThe SF-25’s behaviour is bafflingly unpredictable, which the drivers are far from enjoying, and that costs a significant amount of performance. But it’s not like the car, in its current state, could be a winner anyway.\n\nBoth Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton appeared demoralised when speaking to the media this weekend – a regular occurrence in 2025 as far as the seven-time world champion is concerned, but it was surprising coming from a resolute optimist like Leclerc.\n\nIn Qatar, Ferrari got its worst result of the season – excluding its double DNF at Zandvoort – with Leclerc eighth and Hamilton down in 12th. The team is now 43 points down on third-placed Red Bull, and therefore mathematically assured to finish an underwhelming fourth in the constructors’ championship.\n\nAs [Red Bull Racing]( closes in on deciding the driver line-ups for both of its teams, [Yuki Tsunoda]( needed a strong weekend in Qatar. Not to continue with Red Bull – that ship has clearly sailed – but to stay on the F1 grid altogether by returning to RB.\n\nThe Japanese driver began the weekend strongly, narrowly beating team-mate Verstappen by 0.009s to take fifth in sprint qualifying. In doing so, he became the first driver to out-qualify the Dutchman since [Sergio Perez]( in Azerbaijan last year – in other words, across 37 qualifying sessions.\n\nHowever, the confident version of Tsunoda didn’t last long. He performed adequately in the sprint race, finishing fifth behind Verstappen despite a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits. But later that day, during the main qualifying session, he found himself back in familiar territory.\n\nHe lapped two and a half tenths slower than in sprint qualifying and was knocked out in Q1 for the third consecutive grand prix – and for the tenth time in 26 sessions since joining Red Bull Racing.\n\nHis climb from 15th on the grid to 10th at the chequered flag will surely not suffice, and he now stands on thinner ice than ever. Will the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix be his last in F1 for the time being?\n\nFor the second time this year, Formula 1 mandated an additional stop for teams in the race. In Monaco, a two-stop strategy was called for to try and spice up the action, while Pirelli implemented a 25-lap cap on tyre stints in Qatar over safety concerns – effectively forcing teams into two stops over the 57-lap race.\n\nIn Monaco, it caused chaos that was tricky to keep track of and did nothing to improve the racing. In Qatar, an early safety car forced almost the entire field onto the same strategy – stopping on lap 7 and lap 32 to cover the race distance.\n\nMcLaren was the only team not to stop under the safety car, and this left its drivers effectively fighting back with one hand tied behind their backs after losing out to Verstappen. The stint cap took out all the unpredictability and left McLaren with no option to hold on in hope of another safety car, as it might have done on another given race weekend.\n\n[## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988609) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988064) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988070) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71987749) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988068) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988065) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988063) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988079) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988072) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988077) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988073) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988078) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988076) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988074) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71987999) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988075) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71987909) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988071) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988062) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71987990) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988165) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988614) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988613) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988795) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988800) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988669) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988670) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988665) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988611) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988769) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71989493) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71989494) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71988766) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71990061) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71989498) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71989131) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71989500) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71989497) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71989137) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71990071) [## Qatar GP - Sunday, in photos](/f1/galleries/qatar-gp-sunday-in-photos/10771/#71990077)\n\n## We want your opinion!\n\nWhat would you like to see on Motorsport.com?\n\n[Share on Facebook](  [Share on Twitter]( Qatar GP: Five quick takeaways&via=motorsport)  [Share on WhatsApp](  [Share on Linkedin](  [Share on Pinterest]( Qatar GP: Five quick takeaways)  [Share on Viber](viber://forward?text=\n\n[Previous article Nico Hulkenberg crashes out of Qatar GP causing safety car as McLaren strategy comes under fire](/f1/news/nico-hulkenberg-crashes-out-of-qatar-gp-causing-safety-car-leaves-mclaren-strategy-under-fire/10781238/ \"\"Nico Hulkenberg crashes out of Qatar GP causing safety car as McLaren strategy comes under fire\"\") [Next article F1 Qatar GP: Max Verstappen wins from Oscar Piastri, taking title fight to Abu Dhabi](/f1/news/f1-qatar-gp-race-report/10781244/ \"\"F1 Qatar GP: Max Verstappen wins from Oscar Piastri, taking title fight to Abu Dhabi\"\")\n\nThere are no comments at the moment.

In an odd twist, radiation from the sun appears to play a central role in these events.\n\nThe A320 recently surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the most delivered jetliner in history, and the recall caused havoc to varying degrees for airlines all around the world. Airbus CEO [Guillaume Faury]( said that the recalls were “causing significant logistical challenges and delays.” Colombian airline [Avianca]( said that the issue had affected more than 70% of its fleet and that it had to close ticket sales for flights through December 8.\n\nThe impact of the recall was less severe stateside. Delta and United reported limited impact on its operations while American Airlines said that all 209 of its aircraft that were impacted had been [issued]( the software fix.\n\nAlthough American air travel was spared from major disruptions, the issue was brought to light after an October incident in which an Airbus A320 operated by JetBlue en route from Cancun, Mexico to Newark, New Jersey suddenly dropped in altitude and had to be rerouted to Tampa, Florida for an emergency landing.\n\nAirbus said in a statement on Friday that the recalls were issued because the company found that intense solar radiation could “corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls” in its A320s.\n\nMore specifically, according to an [FAA directive]( the JetBlue flight in October experienced a malfunction in its elevator aileron computer (ELAC), which is a computer that controls the plane’s pitch or nose angle. Airbus believes that solar flares—intense and concentrated streams of electromagnetic solar radiation—may have corrupted the data and caused the ELAC to malfunction, suddenly sending the aircraft plunging down.\n\nThe fix for the issue is a relatively quick revert to earlier software before the planes can fly again, except for some jets that may require a complete hardware replacement.\n\nSolar radiation is a headache for aviation, and the sun has been acting up recently. Back in September, researchers shared that the Sun could be entering an [unexpected active stage]( with a gradual uptick in activity since 2008. Just this past month, the Earth was hit with several violent solar flares, with the NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center flagging two of these flares as capable of triggering widespread radio blackouts.\n\nSpace weather expert Tony Phillips [posited earlier this month]( that giant sunspots had been producing solar flares “for weeks” and that there was “no reason to think this activity will subside.” In a [blog post]( on Sunday, Phillips said that a particularly massive sunspot was now “turning to face Earth” and that future sun flares would have the capacity to cause geomagnetic disturbances.\n\nThe region has unleashed at least two powerful solar flares in the last 12 hours, and experts are certain there's more to come.](\",0.7\ntesla,Crew Injured After Procedures Not Followed - Marine News Magazine,https://www.marinelink.com/news/crew-injured-procedures-not-followed-532975,\"Maritime Activity Reports, Inc.\n\nSafety management system procedures were not effectively implemented when the Spirit of Tasmania I’s second engineer was seriously injured in a fall during engine maintenance earlier this year, the final report from an Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) investigation confirmed.\n\nThe accident occurred during a routine oil change on one of the ship’s main engine turbochargers, while it was berthed in Geelong, Victoria, on March 6.\n\nProblems encountered during the work led to the decision to replace the turbocharger’s bearing housing cover plate. This required climbing on and off the engine several times.\n\nWhile climbing off the engine during the work, the second engineer fell heavily and sustained a serious knee injury, which later required surgery.\n\nThe ATSB’s investigation found a standard safe route to access the top of the main engine was not defined or used, despite access being a regular requirement.\n\n“After working on top of the main engine, the second engineer walked along its rocker covers before stepping across to the opening in the railing, slipping off the cover and falling,” ATSB Director of Transport Safety Stuart Macleod said.\n\nMacleod also noted the decision to replace the bearing housing cover plate represented a significant change to the scope of the work initially planned.\n\nDespite this significant change in scope, the existing Job Safety Analysis was not reviewed, nor was a new prestart safety checklist completed by those conducting the work.\n\n“This was due to perceived time pressure, and a perception by those involved that the work was low risk. Consequently, the risk of slips and falls involved in the work was not properly considered.”\n\nMore broadly, the ATSB’s investigation identified Spirit of Tasmania I’s safety management system procedure for Job Safety Analyses (JSAs) was not effectively implemented at the time of the occurrence.\n\n“This meant the JSA for replacing the main engine turbocharger bearing housing cover plate was not in place, and JSAs covering other work on top of the engine did not address the risks involved in accessing the work site,” Macleod said.\n\nThe ship’s manager, TT-Line, reacted proactively to the accident and put in place several engineering and procedural measures to reduce the risk of falls from the engine top and general access risks.\n\nThe ship’s manager has provided a removable work platform for safe access to the top of the engines for Spirit of Tasmania I and sister ship Spirit of Tasmania II, and the JSAs related to work on turbochargers and the exhaust manifold have been updated to include the access risk.\n\n[Education/Training](/news/maritime/education-training) • [shipping](/news/maritime/shipping) • [Engine](/news/maritime/engine)\n\nOne of Australia's biggest coal export ports will resume operations on Monday, the port operator said, after climate-change…](/news/protesters-disrupt-coal-shipment-532969) [26 Nov 2025\n\nFincantieri and the U.S. Navy have reached an agreement to redefine the future of the Constellation-class frigate program…](/news/us-navy-cancels-four-constellation-532895) [24 Nov 2025\n\nCALL FOR STUDENT  RESEARCH POSTERS!The 16th Annual Maritime Risk Symposium invites undergraduate and graduate students from…](/news/student-research-poster-contest-opens-mrs-532814) [24 Nov 2025\n\nSweden will choose a supplier for its multi-billion Swedish crown acquisition of four new frigates early next year, the defence…](/news/sweden-choose-frigate-supplier-early-532818)\n\n[### ABS Wavesight Advantage™: One Intelligent, Connected Maritime Platform to Transform Complexity into Operational Clarity\n\nIn an industry defined by complexity, regulation, and razor-thin margins, maritime operators are under increasing pressure to simultaneously deliver performance, sustainability, and compliance.]( [### Maritime leaders unite to tackle ocean plastic with launch of new alliance: the Maritime Association for Clean Seas\n\nLeading shipping companies are joining forces to combat ocean plastic pollution through the launch of the Maritime Association for Clean Seas (MACS): a new industry alliance driving measurable](\n\n[### Maritime leaders unite to tackle ocean plastic with launch of new alliance: the Maritime Association for Clean Seas](\n\n[### ABS Wavesight Advantage™: One Intelligent, Connected Maritime Platform to Transform Complexity into Operational Clarity](\n\n**Maritime Reporter E-News** is the maritime industry's largest circulation and most authoritative ENews Service, delivered to your Email five times per week\",0.7\ntesla,Market Data - TheStreet,https://www.thestreet.com/investing/for-now-maybe-through-holidays-stocks-should-move-ahead,\"Here’s what to look for from markets in the last month of the year. Keep a keen eye on the Federal Reserve and tech.\n\n* Major stock indices gained, with S&P 500 ending near its 52-week high.\n\n* Market optimism was driven by Fed comments suggesting possible rate cuts and economic slowdown concerns.\n\n* An end-of-year rally may continue unless disrupted by major events or shocks.\n\nOut of nowhere, on a holiday week no less, it seemed the stock market got a bid.\n\nThe result was weekly gains for all the major averages. The Standard & Poor’s 500 ended about 1% below its 52-week high, and Eli Lilly ended the week still sporting a market capitalization of $1 trillion.\n\nIn the process, the pharmaceutical giant joined [Berkshire Hathaway]( as the only non-tech related companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more.\n\n* Can the stock market continue its bullish run?\n\n* What’s the outlook for December?\n\n* Can we start to hazard a guess about 2026?\n\nTheoretically, the run can continue its run this week and maybe into next week when the [Federal Reserve]( meets to discuss interest rates and the economy. The consensus (if the [CME]( Group’s FedWatch tool is an indicator) is a rate cut is probable.\n\nHawks push pause, doves seek cuts as traders mull rate-cut bet.\n\nJohn Williams, a key Fed official (because he’s president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank), said the risks of an economic slowdown were bigger than more [inflation]( So, interest rate could come down.\n\nMoreover, the [S&P 500]( (and the market generally) has just enjoyed five straight gains and ended Friday only 1% below its 6,920 all-time high reached on Oct. 29.\n\nWe should add the rally was basically prompted by Williams’ speech, given in Chile on Nov, 21.\n\nAs a result, something would have to derail the market. It would have to be an event: A shock runup in bond yields or oil prices, a terrorism attack, explosion in the Middle East or Ukraine, a sudden resignation no one expects.\n\nTJX Companies store brands are overcoming a major headwind.\n\nCould that mean the market could rally through to December as well? Maybe. There are only 22 trading days left in 2025. So, again, you need an abrupt, serious problem.\n\nThe market’s recent [pullback]( was set off by worries that Big Tech, especially Meta Platforms, Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla and Oracle, was investing too much money on artificial intelligence capacity. That is, huge data centers filled with racks of computers tied together with [AI]( chips.\n\nThat worry is probably still on many investors’ minds, but you won’t see it erupt again until the latter half of January when fourth-quarter earnings reports start.\n\nThis is not to deny the attention the recent market pullback received.  Through Nov. 20, the S&P 500 and fell 5.5% and the Nasdaq Composite fell more than 8% after hitting all-time highs on Oct. 29. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.5% from its all-time high, reached on Nov. 12.) The pullback was a surprise, and it actually did need a catalyst to calm investors.\n\nThe catalyst was John Williams’ speech.\n\nHis speech puts a floor under the market for now. And we wait for the Fed’s big event.\n\nGM is continuing to right size its EV production.\n\nNovember, normally one of the better months of the year, closed flat to modestly lower. [Nvidia]( was down 12.6%. Microsoft dropped 5%. Meta slipped 1%. Alphabet jumped almost 14%.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow were basically flat. The Nasdaq and Nasdaq-100 Index each fell about 1.5%.\n\nThree interesting exceptions: Walmart jumped 9.2% in November. Berkshire Hathaway rose 7.6% as [Warren Buffett]( prepares to step down as CEO at the end of the month. [Costco]( Wholesale was up slightly, thanks to a 3.1% gain starting after Monday.\n\nAnd interest rates mostly moved lower anticipating the Fed’s Dec. 10 decision. The 10-year Treasury bond was yielding about 4% on Friday, down from 4.6% when 2025 opened. The 30-year mortgage rate is just above 6.2%, down from 7.25% in January.\n\n* The S&P 500 finished Friday up 16.45% for the year.\n\n* The Nasdaq is up 21% for 2025.\n\n* The Dow industrials are up 12.2%.\n\n* The Russell 2000 Index is up 12.1%.\n\nPart of the unease about the market in recent weeks has much to do with how the gains have been built.\n\nConsider the S&P 500. About 49% of its 38.6% total return since the market bottom in April 2025 (stock price gain plus [dividends]( came just from the Magnificent Seven stocks: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, according to S&P Senior Index analyst Howard Silverblatt.\n\nWhen asked, Silverblatt said he didn’t believe the S&P 500’s total return in any period was so dominated by such a small group of stocks.\n\nFor the year to date, the index is up 17.8% on a total return basis. Without the Mag Seven stocks, the total return falls to 10.24%.\n\nThe latest round of earnings reports is winding up with just 111 companies reporting quarterly results this week.

(NYSE: HD) heads into the week at a critical crossroads: the stock is **down year‑to‑date**, guidance has just been cut, a prominent research house now calls the shares a **“Strong Sell,”** yet most Wall Street analysts still see **double‑digit upside** over the next 12 months. Add in record Black Friday spending, an aggressive holiday promotion campaign and a fresh investor lawsuit investigation, and HD is set up for a potentially volatile start to December. [[1]](\n\nBelow is a structured look at **everything that moved the Home Depot story between November 28–30, 2025**, and how it sets the stage for trading before Monday’s opening bell.\n\nAt that price, HD’s market capitalization sits around **$355 billion**, with a **52‑week range of roughly $326–$439**. [[3]](\n\nOver the past 12 months, HD shares are down **about 15%**, and roughly **6–7% lower year‑to‑date**, underperforming the S&P 500 despite modest revenue growth. [[4]](\n\nHome Depot declared a **quarterly dividend of $2.30 per share**, with an upcoming **ex‑dividend date of December 4, 2025**. At Friday’s close, that implies a forward dividend yield of about **2.5–2.6%**. [[5]](\n\nShort‑term price damage since the November earnings report has left the stock trading **below all its major moving averages**. TipRanks’ technical dashboard flags HD as a **“Sell”**: the **50‑, 100‑ and 200‑day moving averages all sit comfortably above the current share price,** underscoring a downtrend that has yet to fully reverse. [[6]](\n\nFor traders heading into Monday’s open, that means any early strength will be pushing **up into overhead resistance**, not breaking out from a clear base.\n\nAlthough the user‑requested focus is news from **Nov. 28–30**, most of that coverage is still reacting to **Home Depot’s third‑quarter 2025 results**, released on **November 18**—so it’s worth summarising the core numbers.\n\n* **Net sales:** $41.4 billion, up **2.8% year‑on‑year**, helped by roughly **$900 million** of revenue from the recently acquired GMS Inc. [[7]](\n\n* **Comparable sales:** up **0.2% overall** and **0.1% in the U.S.**, essentially flat on an inflation‑adjusted basis. [[8]](\n\n* **Net earnings:** $3.6 billion, or **$3.62 per diluted share**, slightly below last year’s $3.67. [[9]](\n\n* **Adjusted EPS:**$3.74, down from $3.78 a year earlier and **about $0.10 below Wall Street expectations**, marking the **third straight quarterly EPS miss**. [[10]](\n\n* **Adjusted EPS** is now expected to decline about **5% year‑on‑year**, versus the prior forecast for a **2% decline**. [[11]](\n\n* **Total sales** are now expected to grow about **3%** (up slightly from a prior 2.8% forecast).\n\nCEO **Ted Decker** pointed to **a “deep funk” in the U.S. housing market, fewer severe storms, and anxious consumers** cutting back on big‑ticket projects. [[13]](\n\nThose comments are precisely what analysts and law firms have latched onto in the November 28‑30 news flow.\n\n## Fresh Headlines From November 28–30: What Changed for HD?\n\nThe most dramatic shift in sentiment over the weekend came from **Zacks Research**, which **downgraded Home Depot from “Hold” to “Strong Sell”** in a research note cited by several outlets. [[14]](\n\nZacks’ move is notable because it **stands in sharp contrast** to the broader analyst community, which still labels HD a **“Moderate” to “Strong Buy”** with 12‑month targets well above the current price (more on that below).\n\nFor traders, the Zacks call is exactly the sort of headline that can **weigh on pre‑market sentiment** Monday—even if the underlying earnings story has been known for nearly two weeks.\n\nSeveral other analyst updates were highlighted between November 28–30, painting a more nuanced picture:\n\n* **TD Cowen** kept a **Buy** on HD but **cut its price target from $470 to $410**, citing a softer housing backdrop, inventory build‑up and a more cautious macro view after Q3.

[[19]](\n\n* StockAnalysis’ compilation of 23 analysts is even more optimistic, with a **$425** average target—roughly **19% potential upside**—and a consensus rating of **“Strong Buy.”** [[20]](\n\n**Bottom line:** the **Street is trimming expectations**, but not abandoning the name. Monday’s pre‑market tape will likely show investors deciding whether Zacks’ bearish stance or the broader “buy on weakness” view carries more weight.\n\nBetween **November 28–29**, Simply Wall St published **two deep‑dive pieces** on Home Depot that were widely syndicated and are likely to surface in investor feeds on Monday morning:\n\n1. **“Home Depot (HD): Assessing Valuation as Investor Sentiment Shows Signs of Stabilizing” (Nov. 28)**\n\n* Highlights HD’s **modest trading range in late November** as investors digest Q3.\n\n* Notes that sentiment has **stabilised** after the sharp post‑earnings drop but remains fragile. [[21]](\n\n* Reiterates Q3 numbers: roughly **$41.35 billion** in sales and **$3.60 billion** in net income. [[22]](\n\n* Emphasises the updated full‑year outlook of **3% sales growth but a 5% decline in adjusted EPS** amid weak storm activity, housing pressure and consumer uncertainty. [[23]](\n\n* Flags the company’s **AI initiatives**, including the new **Blueprint Takeoffs tool** launched on November 19, which uses AI to automate material lists and quotes for professional builders—potentially supporting long‑term Pro growth and margin efficiency. [[24]](\n\nA related valuation piece concludes that a **discounted cash flow (DCF) model suggests HD may be overvalued by about 14–15%** at current prices, in part because the market could be underestimating the earnings drag from supply‑chain expansion and housing weakness. [[25]](\n\nFor Monday’s open, that sets up a **classic tug of war**: optimistic Wall Street targets vs. more conservative, DCF‑driven models.\n\nA cluster of **13F‑driven headlines between November 28–30** shows institutions **rebalancing**, not fleeing, HD:\n\n* **Norges Bank**, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, disclosed a **new position in Home Depot**, signalling that at least one long‑term, fundamentals‑focused investor is buying the dip. [[26]](\n\n* **West Family Investments Inc.** increased its stake by about **65%** in Q2, now holding 3,630 shares after adding 1,438. [[27]](\n\n+ **New York State Common Retirement Fund** and **Schroder Investment Management** both trimmed holdings, [[28]](\n\n+ And on **November 30**, **Railway Pension Investments Ltd** reported selling **13,800 HD shares**, reducing its stake by **9.7%** to 128,958 shares. [[29]](\n\nTaken together, late‑November data show **mixed but orderly institutional repositioning** rather than a wholesale rush for the exits.\n\nOn **November 30**, law firm **Pomerantz LLP** announced it is **investigating potential claims on behalf of Home Depot shareholders**, a standard first step toward a possible securities‑class‑action suit. [[30]](\n\nWhile details are limited publicly, such investigations typically focus on whether management **misled investors** regarding demand trends, housing market risks or profitability—issues at the center of November’s guidance cut.\n\nThese legal headlines rarely move the stock dramatically on day one, but they **add perceived headline risk** and may add to **pre‑market caution** on Monday, especially with Zacks already waving a red flag.\n\n* **Black Friday 2025 online sales in the U.S. hit a record $11.8 billion**, up **9.1%** from last year, according to Adobe Analytics, with AI‑powered shopping tools playing a major role in driving traffic and conversions. [[31]](\n\n* Mastercard’s SpendingPulse data suggests **overall retail sales (ex‑autos) rose about 4.1%** year‑on‑year on Black Friday, signalling that consumers are still spending despite tariff concerns and a weak labor market. [[32]](\n\nA Barron’s piece notes that **retail stocks have historically risen in the week after Black Friday**, highlighting Home Depot among the names that often benefit from strong post‑holiday sentiment, even though 2025 commentary focuses more on buy‑now‑pay‑later players like Affirm. [[33]](\n\nOn the promotional side, Home Depot’s **Black Friday and Cyber Monday “blowout”** has featured steep discounts on big‑ticket pro tools and home gear—such as large Milwaukee tool combo kits and mechanics’ sets—aimed at both professional contractors and DIY shoppers. [[34]](\n\nHowever, with HD already leaning heavily on promotions, investors will be watching whether **margin pressure worsens** in Q4—an issue flagged by TD Cowen and others when they cut price targets. [[36]](\n\n* HD goes ex‑dividend for its **$2.30 quarterly payout** on **December 4**, with payment later in the month. [[37]](\n\n* Morningstar estimates Home Depot could return **around $75 billion to shareholders over the next five years** via dividends and buybacks, reinforcing its reputation as a **capital‑return powerhouse** even amid near‑term earnings pressure. [[38]](\n\n* Home Depot will host its **2025 Investor and Analyst Conference on December 9**, a key venue for management to expand on the Q3 outlook, discuss AI and Pro initiatives, and potentially reset medium‑term targets. [[39]](\n\n* The **AI‑powered Blueprint Takeoffs tool**, announced November 19, is the latest example of how Home Depot is trying to deepen its grip on professional contractors by embedding itself earlier in the project lifecycle. [[40]](\n\n* Combined with broader efforts like Adobe’s **AI Foundry** partnership, which Home Depot has signed on to leverage for customer engagement, the company is clearly investing to keep its competitive edge even while the housing market is soft. [[41]](\n\nFor longer‑term investors, these events may matter more than the immediate post‑Black‑Friday trading noise.\n\n+ Average 12‑month price targets in the **$405–425** range imply **mid‑teens to high‑teens upside** from Friday’s close, with most analysts rating HD a **Buy or Strong Buy** despite the Q3 stumble. [[42]](\n\n+ Zacks’ **“Strong Sell”** stands out, focusing on **slowing earnings, multiple EPS misses and macro risk**. [[43]](\n\n+ DCF‑based analysis from Simply Wall St suggests the stock might be **~15% overvalued**, arguing the market could be too optimistic about margins while Home Depot spends heavily on supply‑chain expansion. [[44]](\n\n+ Trefis data show that over the last year, HD’s share price has fallen about **15–16%**, even as revenues rose and net margins dipped only modestly; most of that decline is attributed to **P/E multiple compression**, not collapsing fundamentals. [[45]](\n\nIn other words, **Home Depot isn’t a broken business**—but the **price investors are willing to pay for its earnings has come down**, and some models still argue it has further to fall.\n\nHeading into the **December 1, 2025** open, here’s how the late‑November news flow shapes the near‑term setup for Home Depot stock:\n\n* Fundamentals are **mixed**: slow but positive sales growth, flat comps, pressured margins and a softer earnings outlook. [[46]](\n\n* Sentiment is **split**: a **high‑profile “Strong Sell”** call and a **new legal probe** on one side, **dominant Buy ratings and steady institutional interest** on the other. [[47]](\n\n* Record Black Friday and strong early holiday spending suggest **near‑term demand is healthier** than many feared. [[48]](\n\n* But Home Depot’s results and commentary still tie its fortunes closely to a **sluggish housing market and fewer weather‑driven repair projects**—trends that don’t turn overnight. [[49]](\n\n* With the stock at **$356–357**, it trades **well below recent highs** and key moving averages, leaving **room for a relief rally** if holiday data stay strong—or more downside if investors conclude Zacks and the DCF models are right and the multiple still needs to reset lower. [[50]](\n\n* **Ex‑dividend** on December 4 and the **Investor Day** on December 9 will give management two high‑visibility chances to reassure shareholders—or confirm that a slower earnings era is here for a while. [[51]](\n\nFor investors and traders watching the tape before the **December 1 open**, Home Depot sits at a **“show me” moment**:\n\n* Bulls will point to **record holiday spending, strong cash returns and long‑term AI and Pro‑market initiatives**.\n\n* Bears will focus on **guidance cuts, housing‑market headwinds, legal noise and a valuation that some models still see as rich**.\n\nNothing in this article is financial advice; it’s a **news‑style synthesis** of the latest public information as of November 30, 2025. Anyone considering trading HD around Monday’s open should weigh these developments against their own risk tolerance, time horizon and independent research.\n\n1. [portfolioslab.com]( 2.

ABC News,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chinas-factory-activity-contracts-8th-month-november-despite-127972585,\"China’s factory activity contracted for the eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey on Sunday, underscoring challenges for the country’s economy despite the U.S.-China trade truce\n\nHONG KONG -- China’s factory activity contracted for the eighth straight month in November, according to an official survey on Sunday, underscoring challenges for the country’s economy despite the U.S.-China trade truce.\n\nThe official manufacturing purchasing managers index rose slightly to 49.2 in November from 49 in October, China’s National Bureau of Statistics said.\n\nThe PMI is measured on a scale between 0 and 100, with a reading below 50 indicating contraction. The contraction was in line with analyst expectations.\n\nA U.S. tariff cut earlier this month likely would mean that Chinese exports could gain competitiveness in the U.S. market, but it may be too early to say whether exports have regained momentum following the trade truce.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. would cut its tariffs on Chinese goods after meeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea on Oct. 30, raising some optimism over Chinese exports and manufacturing.\n\nA prolonged slump in China’s property market and falling home prices are still hurting consumer confidence, and real estate investments have been down. Intense price competition domestically in many sectors including the auto industry have also put pressure on many businesses.\n\nMore government policy support is required to help boost the economy, economists said.\n\nBut “policymakers appear to be delaying further policy support,” Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING bank, wrote in a note earlier this month.\n\nWhile Chinese authorities previously rolled out measures such as trade-in subsidies for home appliances and electric vehicles, some of these subsidies are set to be phased out, and sales and demand are likely to drop, analysts said.\n\nThe fading boost from the consumer goods trade-in policies may be weighing on domestic demand for manufactured goods and “signals on domestic demand have been mixed,” said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, last week.\n\nChinese officials have set a target of around 5% economic growth for the whole of 2025. The economy expanded 4.8% in the July-September quarter.\n\n“This year’s growth target is likely to require minimal additional support to be reached,” Song wrote.\",0.7\ntesla,\"Autonomous & Self Driving Vehicle News: Pony.ai, Zoox and Tesla - AUTO Connected Car News\",https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2025/11/autonomous-self-driving-vehicle-news-pony-ai-zoox-and-tesla/,\"Pony.ai announced a major expansion of its partnership with Sunlight Mobility, adopting an asset-light model that allows the mobility platform to fund Pony.ai’s Gen-7 Robotaxi fleet. The first vehicles will launch in Guangzhou before the end of 2025, with broader rollout planned across additional Chinese cities.\n\nThe agreement deepens a collaboration that began in 2024 and reflects growing market confidence in Pony.ai’s Robotaxi business, as more third parties are willing to finance fleet deployments and lease the company’s Virtual Driver autonomous system.\n\nSunlight Mobility, which operates in more than 180 cities, will integrate the jointly operated autonomous fleet into both companies’ platforms, combining its digital mobility expertise with Pony.ai’s technology to enhance user experience, improve efficiency, and create shared economic benefits.\n\nPanasonic Energy has signed a multi-year agreement to supply its advanced 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells to Zoox, Amazon’s autonomous ride-hailing subsidiary. Deliveries will begin in early 2026 to support Zoox’s growing purpose-built robotaxi fleet, now scaling production at its Hayward, CA facility and expanding service in cities such as Las Vegas.\n\nThe 2170 cells—known for high energy density, safety, and reliability—will initially ship from Japan, with future production planned at Panasonic Energy’s Kansas plant. Panasonic cites its record of supplying 20 billion cells without battery-related vehicle recalls as evidence of quality.\n\nThe partnership aligns with rapid growth in the robotaxi sector, with the U.S. market valued at $0.45B in 2024 and projected to grow more than 70% annually through 2030. Global robotaxi revenue is forecast to reach $40–50B by 2030.\n\nExecutives from both companies highlighted the collaboration as a milestone in advancing safer, cleaner, and scalable urban mobility.\n\nElon Musk announced that Tesla will “roughly double” its Robotaxi fleet in Austin next month, but the actual numbers reveal a major shortfall from Tesla’s own goals. Musk previously promised 500 Robotaxis in Austin by the end of the year, yet the current fleet is estimated at only about 30 vehicles. Doubling that would bring the total to roughly 60—far below the stated target.\n\nTesla’s Austin Robotaxi pilot, launched in June, uses supervised Model Y vehicles equipped with Hardware 4, not the driverless “Cybercab” shown in October. A Tesla employee remains in the vehicle to monitor operations. The service has struggled with long wait times and “High Service Demand” messages, not due to actual demand but because of the fleet’s very small size.\n\nTo provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

These pared-down EVs lower the starting cost, making it easier for more people to own a Tesla.\n\nThis change is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both cars, I see it as a move that could significantly boost Tesla ownership.\n\nThe idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by eliminating the extras that most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move.\n\nIt comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be seeking more affordable options. According to June figures from [Kelley Blue Book]( the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $49,077, while EVs cost $57,245 on average. That's lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about $10,500 higher than five years ago.\n\n## How much do Tesla's cheaper cars cost, and what do they come with?\n\nThe Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD.\n\nInside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, as well as textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and four-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen, eliminating the need for physical buttons.\n\nTesla includes a seven-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not.\n\n*Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.* [*Add CNET*]( *as a preferred Google source.*\n\nThe rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed internally with a fabric headliner for improved insulation, and the mirrors are manually folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter.\n\nThe Model Y Standard comes standard with 18-inch wheels, with 19-inch wheels available as an optional upgrade, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.\n\nMeanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.\n\nTesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation.\n\nIt retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.\n\nCharging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options.\n\nBoth cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.\n\n[Full Self-Driving]( is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance.\n\nI think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.\n\nIn my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet.\n\nPricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.\n\nFor now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.\n\nConnor is a technology writer and editor, with a byline on multiple platforms.

[TechStock²+1](\n\nOn Wall Street, the NYSE‑listed ADRs (each representing two ordinary shares) last closed on Friday at **US$54.73**, within sight of their 12‑month high near US$59 and valuing the group at roughly **US$138–139 billion**. [[1]](\n\nAcross markets, BHP sits mid‑range between its 52‑week highs and lows, on a **mid‑teens price‑to‑earnings multiple** and a **dividend yield around 4%**. [[2]](\n\nThis article pulls together the key news, data and forecasts investors are watching on 1 December 2025. It is **informational only and not financial advice.**\n\n* **ASX:BHP (Australia)** – Around A$41.9 intraday on 1 December, with a 12‑month range of roughly A$33–44 and a 52‑week gain of about 4–5%. [TechStock²+1](\n\n* **NYSE:BHP (ADRs)** – US$54.73 at the 28 November close, versus a 52‑week range of US$39.73–58.92. [[3]](\n\nOn the ASX, BHP’s market capitalisation is about **A$212 billion**, with a trailing **P/E near 15.4x** and a **4.0% dividend yield** based on the past 12 months’ distributions. [[4]](\n\nOn the ADRs, Google Finance and other data providers peg the trailing P/E around **15–15.5x** and the dividend yield just over **4%**, again pointing to a “quality at a fair price” setup rather than an obvious bargain or bubble. [[5]](\n\nBHP paid **US$1.10 per ordinary share (US$2.20 per ADR)** in dividends for FY25, implying an annual payout of about **US$5.6 billion** and a payout ratio around **55–70%** depending on the metric used. [TechStock²+2StockAnalysis+2](\n\nThe headline corporate story is BHP’s decision to walk away from its latest attempt to acquire Anglo American.\n\n* On 23–24 November, BHP confirmed that, after preliminary talks, it is **“no longer considering a combination”** with Anglo American. [[6]](\n\n* UK takeover rules now **bar BHP from making a fresh bid for six months**, unless Anglo or a rival bidder changes the situation. [[7]](\n\n* The failed approach would have been a **US$60–75 billion copper‑heavy mega‑merger**, intended in part to disrupt Anglo’s planned tie‑up with Teck Resources, which is due for a shareholder vote on 9 December. [[8]](\n\n* **Strategic frustration:** Multiple failed bids (in 2024 and now 2025) highlight how difficult it has been for BHP to buy growth in copper, even as the company leans on acquisitions and expansions to secure long‑life resources. [[9]](\n\n* **Back to basics:** With the Anglo deal shelved, BHP is effectively locked into an **“organic growth first”** strategy at least through mid‑2026, with the focus back on delivering Jansen potash in Canada and copper expansions in Chile and South Australia. [[10]](\n\nFor shareholders, the immediate takeaway is clearer strategic direction but also the sense that BHP is still hunting for ways to grow its copper exposure without overpaying.\n\nA much more immediate risk factor is playing out in BHP’s largest profit pool: iron ore sales to China.\n\nOn 30 September, Singapore’s *Business Times* reported that **China Mineral Resources Group (CMRG)** – Beijing’s centralised iron‑ore buyer – had **asked major steelmakers and traders to halt purchases of all new BHP iron ore cargoes**, escalating a dispute over contract pricing. [[11]](\n\n* The halt extends an earlier restriction on specific products (such as Jimblebar blend fines), widening it to **all new US‑dollar‑denominated seaborne cargoes from BHP** while talks are stalled.\n\n* Existing supplies and non‑BHP cargoes continue, but mills have begun **adjusting their blends to alternative ores**, highlighting that China is willing to pressure individual suppliers. [[12]](\n\nDaily iron‑ore price reports suggest the overall market has stayed surprisingly resilient, but the episode underlines two uncomfortable truths for BHP:\n\n1. **China is still by far its largest iron‑ore customer**.\n\n2. A state‑backed buyer like CMRG can weaponise volume and price negotiations in ways that create intermittent shocks to sales and sentiment. [[13]](\n\nThe tension has already shown up in ASX trading: articles on 21 November highlighted that BHP shares came under pressure as China broadened its iron‑ore restrictions, even though the affected products represent a relatively small slice of BHP’s portfolio. [TechStock²+1](\n\nA second major overhang is legal rather than commercial.\n\nOn **14 November 2025**, the **English High Court** ruled that BHP is liable under Brazilian law for the **2015 Fundão tailings dam failure** in Mariana, Brazil, in group litigation brought by more than 600,000 claimants. [[14]](\n\n* The court found BHP to be a **“polluter” under Brazilian environmental law** and at fault under Brazil’s civil code, although it rejected liability arguments under Brazilian corporate law.\n\n* The decision is the first stage in a multi‑stage process. Trials on **causation and damages** are scheduled into **2026–2029**, and payments, if any, are unlikely before a third trial after 2028. [[15]](\n\n* BHP has already entered into a **US$32 billion Brazil‑wide remediation agreement** with local authorities (with Vale and Samarco) and has provided **more than US$13 billion** for reparation and compensation, of which about US$6.3 billion has been paid to over 610,000 people. [[16]](\n\n* BHP’s **provision associated with Samarco and the Brazil agreement is now estimated at US$5.5 billion as of 31 October 2025**, with expected cash outflows of around **US$2.2 billion in FY26 and US$0.5 billion in FY27**.\n\n* Management warns that **actual outcomes could be materially higher or lower** than the current provision as facts evolve and appeals progress. [[17]](\n\nThe UK ruling doesn’t immediately change BHP’s cash flows, but it keeps litigation risk firmly on the radar and partly explains why some models build in a valuation discount for legal uncertainty.\n\nWhile the headlines have focused on Anglo and China, regulatory filings show **steady institutional accumulation** through 2025:\n\n* A series of filings highlighted by TechStock and MarketBeat show **Quadrant Capital Group, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and others** boosting BHP positions in the first half of 2025. [TechStock²](\n\n* On 30 November, MarketBeat reported that **Franklin Resources Inc.** increased its BHP ADR stake by **48.2%**, to roughly **383,000 ADRs worth about US$18.4 million** at quarter‑end. [[18]](\n\n* The same reports suggest that around **3–4% of the free float** is now held by hedge funds and institutional investors tracked in those datasets, with broader institutional ownership on the ASX north of 50%. [[19]](\n\nThe dollar amounts are small relative to BHP’s vast market cap, but the direction of travel is clear: for many asset managers, BHP remains a **core large‑cap mining exposure**, not a name to avoid.\n\nBHP’s financial year ended 30 June 2025 delivered a familiar mix of **strong operations and weaker commodity prices**:\n\n* Underlying attributable profit from continuing operations fell **26% year‑on‑year to about US$10.2 billion**, as lower realised iron‑ore and coal prices outweighed higher copper production and prices. [[20]](\n\n* Revenue declined **8%** to roughly **US$51.3 billion**, missing some analyst expectations but consistent with the price‑driven headwinds across bulk commodities. [[22]](\n\n* **Iron ore production hit a record 263 million tonnes**, within guidance, with Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) delivering record output despite cyclones and infrastructure tie‑ins. [[23]](\n\n* **Copper production rose around 8% to a record ~2.0 million tonnes**, driven by Escondida in Chile and ramp‑ups in South Australia. [[24]](\n\n* Coal was more mixed: steelmaking coal volumes improved, but lower prices and weaker energy coal markets dragged segment EBITDA sharply lower. [[25]](\n\nBHP’s underlying EBITDA margin slipped slightly but remained above 50%, and profit from operations actually rose double‑digits, underscoring how much of the earnings hit came from commodity prices rather than operational stress. [[26]](\n\nFor **FY26 (year to June 2026)**, BHP’s production guidance implies another year of high volumes: [[27]](\n\n* **Iron ore:** 258–269 Mt (WAIO 251–262 Mt), slightly above FY25 levels at the mid‑point.\n\n* **Copper:** 1,800–2,000 kt – allowing for some flexibility if grades or mine plans move around.\n\n* **Steelmaking coal:** 18–20 Mt (36–40 Mt on a 100% basis).\n\nUnit‑cost guidance remains competitive: WAIO unit costs are forecast around **US$18.25–19.75 per tonne**, with key copper operations such as Escondida and the South Australian assets targeted in the **US$1.00–2.40 per pound** cost range depending on the mine. [[28]](\n\nThe **Q1 FY26 operational review (quarter ended 30 September 2025)** sets the tone heading into December: [[29]](\n\n* Group **copper production increased 4% year‑on‑year**, with record concentrator throughput at Escondida.\n\n* WAIO delivered another **strong quarter with record material mined**, while major rail and port debottlenecking projects continued to ramp up.\n\n* **Steelmaking coal output rose about 8%**, benefiting from improved mining conditions.\n\nManagement described the macro backdrop as **“constructive”**, noting resilient demand signals for copper and potash despite slower global growth, and reiterated that full‑year production guidance remains on track. [TechStock²+1](\n\n* **Jansen potash (Canada)** – Stage 1 is roughly **three‑quarters complete**, with first production still expected in 2027; Stage 2 is underway, laying the foundation for BHP to become a material potash producer into the 2030s. [TechStock²+1](\n\n* **Copper expansions** – Environmental and regulatory approvals for Escondida’s Laguna Seca expansion and further South Australian development support long‑run copper output. [TechStock²+1](\n\nThe medium‑term copper story remains a major pillar of the BHP investment case.\n\nIn a **24 November note**, UBS raised its copper price forecasts and deficit estimates, citing persistent mine disruptions, slower output growth and strong demand from electrification, EVs, grids and data‑centre build‑out: [[30]](\n\n* March 2026 price target lifted to **US$11,500/t**.\n\n* New December 2026 target of **US$13,000/t**.\n\n* Expected market deficits widened to **230,000 tonnes in 2025** and **407,000 tonnes in 2026**.\n\nFor a diversified miner whose copper earnings are already rising and where copper will increasingly rival iron ore in importance, these projections are clearly supportive.\n\nSet against that copper optimism is the reality that **iron ore still generates a large chunk of BHP’s cash flow**, and the power dynamics in that market are changing.\n\n* BHP is one of the “big three” seaborne iron‑ore suppliers to China, but CMRG’s temporary ban on new BHP cargoes during pricing disputes shows how Beijing is using centralised buying to squeeze suppliers on contract terms. [[31]](\n\n* Recent daily reports indicate only modest moves in benchmark iron‑ore prices, but BHP’s share price has reacted sharply to each escalation in the standoff. [TechStock²+1](\n\nFor investors, the message is that **iron‑ore volume risk remains low in the long run**, but **pricing and contract risk is rising**, and that risk is amplified by geopolitics.\n\nAcross major broker and data platforms, the consensus on BHP as of 1 December 2025 can be summarised as **“solid company, fairly valued”**:\n\n* MarketBeat data for the ADRs show **1 Strong Buy, 7 Hold, 1 Sell**, for an overall **“Hold” rating** and a **consensus price target around US$48.50** – below the current US$54–55 trading range. [[32]](\n\n* London‑listed shares are similarly flagged as **“Reduce” or “Hold”** on average, with price targets below the current 2,000p‑plus level. [TechStock²+1](\n\n* Zacks places BHP in **Rank #3 (Hold)**, reflecting decent fundamentals but no clear near‑term catalyst to drive outperformance versus the wider basic materials sector. [[33]](\n\nShort‑term technical tools tend to show **mildly bullish** setups (price above long‑term moving averages, but not overbought), which is consistent with a stock grinding higher rather than exploding upward. [TechStock²+1](\n\n* **Discounted‑cash‑flow models** at Simply Wall St put fair value for the ASX shares at around **A$47–48**, implying low‑double‑digit upside from current levels and framing BHP as modestly undervalued. [[34]](\n\n* **StockAnalysis** and similar sites show trailing **P/E ratios in the mid‑teens**, **EV/EBITDA around 6.5x** and **ROE above 20%**, which are not demanding multiples for a miner with BHP’s balance sheet and asset quality, but also not “fire‑sale” territory. [[35]](\n\n* AI‑ and factor‑driven platforms highlighted in recent coverage (for example, Danelfin’s AI score) broadly frame BHP as a **“probable outperformer”** over the next few months, but only by a few percentage points relative to broader indices – again consistent with a quality blue‑chip at roughly fair value. [TechStock²](\n\nIn practical terms, valuation views range from **“modest upside”** (in DCF‑driven models) to **“limited upside and fully priced”** (in broker target averages).\n\nPulling the threads together, three broad risk clusters stand out for anyone following BHP in December 2025:\n\nEven if current bans and curbs focus on specific ore blends and bargaining tactics, they highlight the vulnerability that comes from **heavy reliance on a single big customer**. A prolonged or expanded restriction could lower realised prices or force BHP to discount into other markets. [[36]](\n\nThe **UK group action over the Samarco dam failure** is entering a more concrete phase, with liability now established (subject to appeal) and damages to be argued in trials into the late 2020s. Provisions may prove too low or too high, but either way, litigation and ESG narratives will remain a drag on BHP’s risk profile. [[37]](\n\nMega‑projects like **Jansen potash** and long‑dated copper expansions demand billions in capex and years of execution. Delays or cost overruns could sap free cash flow and returns just as new competitors – including a potential Anglo‑Teck copper giant – scale up. [[38]](\n\n+ World‑class positions in **iron ore and copper**, with record volumes in FY25 and competitive unit costs. [[39]](\n\n+ A growing **potash business** that could become a major profit centre in the 2030s. [TechStock²+1](\n\n+ A **robust balance sheet**, respectable free‑cash‑flow yield and a **~4% dividend**, attractive to income‑oriented investors. [[40]](\n\n+ Material upside exposure to a potential **structural copper deficit**, as highlighted by UBS and others. [[41]](\n\n+ **Valuation that already bakes in a lot of good news**, with the stock trading above average broker targets. [[42]](\n\n+ A long‑running **litigation cloud** from the Samarco disaster, now reinforced by an adverse UK judgment. [[44]](\n\n* Any **headlines on CMRG negotiations** and China’s iron‑ore stance.\n\n* Developments in the **Anglo‑Teck merger** and broader copper‑sector M&A.\n\n* Moves in **copper and iron‑ore futures**, given their direct transmission into BHP’s daily price action.

Today I found another one. Though, it actually launched a little before the Tesla one. It’s a new hub with 18 fast chargers for fleet vehicles. The [press release]( from Terawatt Infrastructure says the source of electricity is renewables. “Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session.”\n\nThe location is Rialto, California, about 56 miles east of Los Angeles. The new fleet charging hub provides:\n\n* 24/7 security with 360-degree cameras and gated access to protect vehicles, cargo, and drivers.\n\nFor people who might think this new site is just a one-off, Terawatt opened a similarly sized hub [in April]( “The private site, shared among multiple fleets, will house a total of 20 pull-through and bobtail DC fast charging stalls and boast a capacity of 7MW — enabling charging for up to 125 trucks per day.”\n\nBut let’s get back to the [Rialto hub]( “The Rialto site brings Terawatt’s vision of a connected, electrified network to life. It provides fast, reliable, and high-speed pull-through charging along an electric lane that runs from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles through Vernon and Commerce, culminating in Rialto. Our network enables companies to reduce emissions and run a variety of routes across a number of vehicle classes with the confidence of a dependable charging solution. EV fleets can now travel further, more cleanly, without slowing down their operations,” said Neha Palmer, CEO and co-founder of Terawatt.\n\nSolar power canopies generate electricity and don’t require vast amounts of land. They also provide shade and protection from precipitation.\n\nThere has been much good news about new EV charger installations lately, despite the loss of the federal EV incentives and a Trump administration that is anti-EV.\n\nUsing fully electric medium- and-heavy-duty freight trucks reduces harmful air pollution because they don’t burn diesel fuel or gasoline. There are some environmental benefits as well.\n\n* In the five-county region of Southern California, **119,200 workers** are employed in the EV industry, which is 43.4 percent of all statewide jobs (275,600) in the EV industry.\n\n* In California, the EV industry pays an average annual wage of $91,300, well above the average annual wage across all industries of $68,500.\n\n*Sign up for [CleanTechnica's Weekly Substack for Zach and Scott's in-depth analyses and high level summaries]( sign up for [our daily newsletter]( and [follow us on Google News](\n\n*Have a tip for CleanTechnica?

According to their recent report on USDT, Tether’s reserves have shifted toward more volatile holdings over the past year. These perceived riskier assets, such as bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate bonds, now make up 24% of the reserve mix, up from 17% in 2024.\n\nOne of S&P’s sharpest criticisms in its downgrade of USDT lies in its growing reliance on bitcoin in particular as a reserve asset, now comprising 5.6% of the backing, which is well above the 3.9% reserve buffer Tether itself flagged in its latest quarterly report ([PDF]( According to S&P, this exposure amplifies risks tied to bitcoin’s notorious volatility.\n\nS&P also sees serious issues regarding transparency at Tether, as the stablecoin issuer’s attestations offer little more than high-level snapshots, with zero granularity on who holds these assets, how they’re custodied, or what counterparties lurk in the shadows.\n\nThat said, Tether’s reserves still lean heavily on short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, accounting for 75% of the reserves. Despite the alleged red flags from S&P, USDT has held its $1 peg through many of crypto’s wild rides over the years, notably handling billions in redemptions without a hitch during the [collapse of crypto exchange FTX](\n\nA Tether spokesperson told *Reuters* the company “strongly disagrees” with S&P’s assessment, which uses an outdated model that ignores USDT’s track record and role as vital infrastructure in emerging markets.\n\n[Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino went further on X]( framing the downgrade as a badge of honor: Tether “wears S&P’s loathing with pride,” thriving as an “overcapitalized” outsider to a flawed legacy system. “The classical rating models built for legacy financial institutions, historically led private and institutional investors to invest their wealth into companies that despite being attributed investment grade ratings collapsed,” Ardoino added.\n\n[In another post]( Ardoino pointed to Tether’s latest attestation [announcement]( where the company also claimed an excess reserve buffer approaching $30 billion; however, this is not explicitly part of USDT’s current reserves.\n\n# Trust S&P or Trust Bitcoin?\n\nIn another post, Ardoino referenced S&P’s failures during the 2008 financial crisis, which were portrayed by a blind woman in the associated film The Big Short. [S&P paid a $1.375 billion settlement]( in a related case with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding allegations that the ratings agency had defrauded investors with its ratings of financial products in the lead up to the housing crisis. Notably, Bitcoin itself was originally launched in January 2009, almost as a direct response to the collapse of trust involved in the financial crisis.\n\nJust weeks before scrutinizing Tether, [S&P also slapped a speculative ‘B-‘ issuer credit rating on bitcoin treasury company Strategy]( highlighting the firm’s $80 billion-plus bitcoin hoard as a vulnerability that could cripple debt payments amid market plunges. The agency’s outlook stays stable for now, but it flags Strategy’s negative cash flow and bitcoin concentration as red flags, much like the volatility risks baked into USDT’s reserves.\n\nWhile S&P sees issues with Tether and Strategy using bitcoin as a reserve asset, many other well-known institutions, such as [the Harvard University Endowment]( and [the state of Texas]( are buying the crypto asset to hold for the long term and find it to be useful as an apolitical, digital store of value.\n\nIt should also be noted that S&P is largely focused on stablecoin issuers’ ability to redeem tokens for dollars in their assessments, so an asset like USDT where the issuer is operating more like a bank issuing its own private currency doesn’t necessarily fit the mold perfectly. In other words, USDT may be viewed negatively by many in the traditional financial system because it is operating on a new standard built on bitcoin rather than the traditional, dollar-based system.\n\n[### U.S. Bank Calls Ability to Freeze Stablecoins ‘Appealing’ as Crypto Has Completely Lost the Plot\n\nThe endowment dramatically increased its holdings of a spot bitcoin ETF since its previous such report.](\",0.4\nbitcoin,\"Bitcoin Plunges to Below $88,000 in Risk-Off Start to December - Bloomberg.com\",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-01/bitcoin-btc-slides-to-below-88-000-in-risk-off-start-to-december,\"[Confidential tip?\n\nCryptocurrencies fell sharply on Monday, bringing fresh momentum to a wide-ranging selloff that appeared to have settled.\n\nBitcoin slid as much as 4.3% to below $88,000 in early Asia trading, while Ether dropped 6% to below $2,900, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n[Bitcoin’s Drawdown Breaks Old Rule as Volatility Stays Tame]( Tops $90,000 as Options Point Toward Shifting Sentiment]( Pomp SPAC Deals Are Put to the Test by Crypto Crash]( Kwon Says Five Years in Prison Enough for Terra Crypto Fraud]( Exchange Upbit Hit by Exploit After $10 Billion Deal](\",0.4\nbitcoin,Where will leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin be in 5 years? - USA Today,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/11/30/where-will-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-be-in-5-years/87537679007/,\"[Texas A&M falls out of top 5 in college football poll as Ohio State remains No. 1](/story/sports/ncaaf/2025/11/30/college-rankings-football-top-25-coaches-poll-week-14/87531678007/)\n\n[Get shopping texts 🛍️](/story/shopping/sign-up-for-usa-today-shopping-text-alerts/84130910007/) [All things auto 🚙](/cars) [Moving?

In the past five years, the leading cryptocurrency has soared 409% (as of Nov. 26).\n\nInvestors might be inclined to take a chance on Bitcoin on the recent dip. But where will this digital asset be in 2030?\n\nBitcoin has had a monster rise over the past decade. However, investors shouldn't extrapolate those gains going forward. The reasonable outlook is to expect lower returns, since the asset is maturing.\n\nThat being said, it wouldn't be surprising to see Bitcoin's price triple by the end of 2030. To do this, it would need togenerate a robust[compound annual rate of return]( of 25%. This would surely outperform the stock market by a wide margin.\n\nBitcoin's best trait is that it has a hard supply cap of 21 million units. This scarcity makes it a compelling asset to own, particularly as fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, constantly lose[purchasing power]( over time.\n\nThe current regulatory backdrop works to Bitcoin's benefit as well, making it easier for companies to build related products and services and for investors to access the crypto.\n\nBitcoin currently trades at around $88,000. In five years, it's not out of reach for it to trade around the $270,000 mark, if the bull run continues.

After hitting a record above **$126,000 in early October 2025**, BTC slid sharply in November, briefly dropping near **$80,000** before stabilising. [[1]](\n\nBy 30 November 2025, Bitcoin is trading just above **$91,000**, according to multiple market data providers and price analyses. [[2]](\n\nAgainst that volatile backdrop, **Bitcoin price forecasts for 2026 are wildly split**. Serious models and analysts are now calling for anything from **$50,000** at the low end to **$300,000+** — with some aggregated forecasts stretching as high as **$500,000**.\n\nThis article pulls together the latest **2026 Bitcoin price predictions**, the macro and policy drivers behind them, and a few grounded scenarios to help you interpret the noise. It’s **informational only**, not financial advice.\n\nBefore digging into forecasts, it helps to understand the setup.\n\n* **New all‑time high, then a harsh reset.** Research from YouHodler and other analysts places Bitcoin’s all‑time high around **$126,000–$126,200 in early October 2025**. [[3]](\n\n* **A 30%+ November drawdown.** The Economic Times reports that BTC dropped roughly **31% in November**, falling from the October peak toward **$82,000** amid hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric, rising yields and nearly **$2 billion in crypto liquidations**. [[4]](\n\n* **ETF-driven but choppy demand.** BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has exploded to about **$70+ billion in assets**, helping push total BlackRock Bitcoin ETF allocations near **$100 billion** and making them the firm’s biggest revenue driver — but November also saw more than **$2.3 billion** in outflows as prices fell. [[5]](\n\n* **Policy tailwinds in the US.** The Trump administration has leaned into Bitcoin: Standard Chartered notes that BTC first broke **$100,000** after his election, and the bank now projects aggressive upside as regulatory and accounting rules become friendlier. [[6]](\n\nAt the same time, **macro uncertainty is high**. In November, DL News highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs just had their worst month for outflows since February, while analysts fret about liquidity, AI-bubble risks in equities and a divided Federal Reserve. [[7]](\n\nIn short: Bitcoin enters the 2026 window **battle‑tested**, heavily owned by institutions and governments, but sensitive to interest rates, liquidity and risk appetite.\n\nTraditional finance has finally embraced making explicit multi‑year Bitcoin calls — and they don’t agree with each other at all.\n\n* **Pro‑crypto US policy** under President Trump, including a federal working group on digital assets and discussion of a national digital asset stockpile. [[9]](\n\n* **ETFs unleashing pent‑up institutional demand**, with tens of billions flowing into spot products. [[10]](\n\n* **Falling volatility**, making BTC more acceptable as an institutional portfolio allocation alongside gold.\n\n### Bernstein / MarketWatch: Up to ~$200,000 on an “extended cycle”\n\n* The **current bull run, which began in 2023, could stretch through 2026 and peak in 2027**.\n\n* Bitcoin could climb toward **$200,000 within about a year**, helped by US pro‑crypto policies (including a proposed federal Bitcoin reserve) and sustained ETF adoption. [[11]](\n\nThis view effectively argues that the classic four‑year Bitcoin cycle may **“break” or lengthen** as policy and institutional flows matter more than simple halving math.\n\nOn the other side, Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist **Mike McGlone** has become a high‑profile bear:\n\n* He argues Bitcoin could **drop around 40%** from autumn levels and trade near **$50,000 in 2026** — roughly 60% below its $126k high. [[12]](\n\n* In a widely cited LinkedIn post, he framed the dilemma as **“Bitcoin $50,000 or $150,000 in 2026?”** and said his **bias is toward $50,000**, especially if the S&P 500 suffers a rare third down year in this cycle. [[13]](\n\n* **Gold outperforming** while crude oil and stocks wobble encourages investors to de‑risk away from volatile assets like BTC. [[14]](\n\n* **ETF outflows and liquidity stress** could deepen, mirroring the 2018 post‑bubble crash.\n\nJPMorgan hasn’t published a headline‑grabbing 2026 BTC price target, but its mining sector research gives clues:\n\n* The bank recently **upgraded selected miners** such as Cipher Mining and CleanSpark, lifting their **December 2026**price targets on expectations that high‑performance computing and AI workloads will support miner economics even if BTC prices stay under pressure. [[15]](\n\n* The Economic Times highlights their modelling as consistent with a **crypto “rebound” into 2026**, even after November’s sharp pullback. [[16]](\n\nThe takeaway: **Big banks are split** between extremely bullish trajectories (200k–300k) and more cautious or even bearish paths (~50k). None of them treat current levels near 90k as a comfortable equilibrium.\n\nCrypto‑native platforms and research shops tend to produce **structured, year‑by‑year tables**. While they’re not independent investment advice, they help map out the current sentiment.\n\n+ **2026 range: $100,000–$189,900** (updated November 2025).\n\n+ They describe this as a “conservative” range and see a broader long‑term path toward **$300,000 by 2030** if adoption continues. [[17]](\n\n+ FAQ section suggests Bitcoin could reach about **$173,672 by end‑2026**, assuming constructive long‑term trends. [[19]](\n\n+ Based on inputs from Binance users, the 2026 BTC value is projected around **$96,290.96** — essentially a modest gain from today. [[20]](\n\n+ Under a simple model assuming BTC appreciates **5% per year**, Kraken’s calculator produces a **2026 price of about $95,939.55** and around **$189,953 by 2040**. [[21]](\n\n+ Kraken explicitly notes this isn’t a forecast but a math exercise based on user‑chosen growth rates.\n\n+ A late‑September analysis collated public forecasts and found **2026 price targets ranging roughly from $60,000 to $500,000**, with a **median near $201,000** when outliers are included. [[22]](\n\n+ A November 2025 feature asked ChatGPT to summarise existing 2026 BTC models. The article reports that published projections span from roughly **$99,000 on the low end** (InvestingHaven’s minimum) to about **$228,000** (an optimistic model dubbed Orange Standard), with several mid‑range forecasts around **$120,000–$165,000**. [[23]](\n\n> **Most crypto‑oriented forecasts cluster around a six‑figure BTC price in 2026**, typically between **$100,000 and $200,000**, assuming the current cycle doesn’t completely break down.\n\nAt the same time, tools from Binance and Kraken show that **small changes in assumed growth rates** dramatically shift these numbers — a reminder that many “forecasts” are really **parameter‑driven scenarios**, not crystal balls.\n\nNumbers aside, 2026 Bitcoin forecasts hinge on a few powerful themes.\n\n* BlackRock’s **IBIT** and its Brazil‑listed cousin have reached **around $100 billion in combined allocations** and now generate more revenue for the firm than long‑standing legacy ETFs. [[24]](\n\n* IBIT alone holds roughly **3.9% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply**, according to ZyCrypto’s reporting, underscoring how much of BTC’s float is now locked inside regulated vehicles. [[25]](\n\n* Continued **net inflows** into spot ETFs.\n\n* More jurisdictions (and potentially new products like leveraged, options‑based or yield ETFs) widening access.\n\n* Liquidity draining from risk assets if central banks stay tighter for longer.\n\n### 4.2 Halving cycles vs. “breaking the cycle”\n\nBitcoin’s **fourth halving** in 2024 cut new supply again, and historically, BTC has peaked **12–18 months after** a halving. Classic cycle models would therefore expect a major top sometime in **late 2025 or early 2026**.\n\n* Bernstein’s research (via MarketWatch) suggests the current bull run could **extend into 2026 and even 2027**, driven by policy and ETF demand, not just halving math. [[27]](\n\n* A Forbes contributor (in a paywalled piece) framed **2026 as a year of “breaking cycles”**, arguing that Bitcoin and stablecoins are increasingly tied to institutional behaviour, cross‑border payments and state‑level adoption rather than retail mania alone. [[28]](\n\nIf they’re right, **2026 could be more like the middle of a super‑cycle** than the tail end of the usual four‑year pattern.\n\n* Standard Chartered ties its aggressive BTC projections directly to **Trump‑era pro‑crypto moves**, including looser accounting rules and a friendlier regulatory framework. [[29]](\n\n* A separate DL News report describes the **“Bitcoin for America Act”**, a bill from Representative Warren Davidson that would allow Americans to **pay federal income taxes in Bitcoin**, with the proceeds flowing into a **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** now estimated around **$16 billion**. [[30]](\n\n> The idea that **nation‑states will compete to accumulate Bitcoin** is moving from Twitter meme to serious policy discussion — and that’s explicitly built into some of the higher 2026 forecasts.\n\nEven the best Bitcoin models crumble if the macro backdrop swings hard. Analysts watching 2026 point to several key variables:\n\n+ DL News notes that some Russian market experts see **no full Bitcoin recovery before spring 2026** if the Fed doesn’t ease policy. [[31]](\n\n+ Futures markets currently price a high probability of cuts in 2026 — but policymakers are openly divided on timing and magnitude. [[32]](\n\n+ CryptoNews reports on concerns from **Robert Kiyosaki** and others about a “global liquidity reset” driven by Japan’s changing fiscal stance and the unwinding of leveraged yen carry trades, which could temporarily hurt risk assets including BTC. [[33]](\n\n+ DL News links recent crypto drawdowns to equity volatility as investors question whether massive AI capex will pay off, pulling capital from high‑beta assets like Bitcoin. [[34]](\n\n* **2020–2021:** Aggressive easing, booming liquidity and tech optimism → most 200k–300k Bitcoin scenarios look more plausible.\n\n* **2018 or 2022:** Sticky inflation, balance‑sheet tightening and risk‑off sentiment → the more pessimistic 50k–80k paths come into play.\n\nForecasts are really just **different assumptions about that macro dice roll**.\n\nPulling all this together, you can group the current 2026 Bitcoin forecasts into three broad bands. These are not my predictions, just a way to organise what the market is saying.\n\n* Warnings about **ETF outflows**, liquidity drains and AI‑bubble fallout from multiple market commentators. [[36]](\n\n* **No sustained Fed easing**; rates stay high or cut only modestly.\n\n* ETFs flip from net buyers to **persistent net sellers**.\n\n* Bitcoin behaves more like a **high‑beta tech stock**, underperforming gold and sovereign bonds.\n\n* The 2024–26 cycle rhymes with **2017–2018**, with a long, grinding comedown from the 2025 peak.\n\nIn this scenario, Bitcoin is still far above its 2022 lows, but many of the six‑figure forecasts prove **too optimistic, too soon**.\n\n* Nasdaq / GOBankingRates’ summary of models between roughly **$99k and $228k**, with several mid‑range projections. [[40]](\n\n* **Macro softens gradually**: rates drift lower, but no huge money‑printing spree.\n\n* Spot ETFs keep a **net‑positive but choppy** flow profile, with periods of outflows offset by renewed interest. [[41]](\n\n* Bitcoin carves out a broad **six‑figure trading range**, with periodic spikes above 150k and sharp pullbacks, but no structural breakdown below prior cycle highs for long.\n\n* The 2024 halving still matters, but the peak doesn’t arrive in a clean 12–18 month window — price action is choppier and more drawn‑out.\n\nFor long‑term holders, this scenario still represents **solid real returns**, but the path is noisy enough that **leverage and over‑sizing can be dangerous**.\n\n* Bernstein’s extended‑cycle view, with a potential move toward **$200,000** as ETFs and a federal Bitcoin reserve reshape demand. [[43]](\n\n* YouHodler and other bullish long‑term models that see **$170k+** in the second half of the decade, with upside to **$250k–$700k by 2030** in optimistic scenarios. [[44]](\n\n* CryptoSlate’s compilation of public forecasts that stretches the **2026 high‑end up to about $500,000** in extreme cases. [[45]](\n\n* **Aggressive global ETF and institutional adoption**; pension funds, insurers and sovereign wealth funds make Bitcoin a standard allocation. [[46]](\n\n* The **US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** concept gains traction; paying taxes in BTC and similar policies encourage governments to accumulate rather than sell. [[47]](\n\n* Gold stagnates or loses mindshare as “digital gold” becomes a mainstream thesis.\n\n* Halving plus policy plus macro relief create **compounding tailwinds**, driving a parabolic leg that pushes BTC well beyond 150k – potentially into the Standard Chartered 300k zone.\n\nThis outcome is **not impossible** — but it requires **multiple favourable forces to line up at once**, with surprisingly few policy or macro shocks along the way.\n\nIf you’re reading Bitcoin price predictions for 2026, you’re probably thinking about **positioning**. A few practical ways to treat these forecasts as tools, not gospel:\n\nNotice how serious forecasters mostly give **bands** (e.g. $100k–$190k), not precise ticks. Treat any 2026 number as a **zone of possibility**, not a promise.\n\nA model saying “BTC could be 150k in 2026” doesn’t tell you whether it visits **50k first**. Many 2026 outlooks, including Kiyosaki’s and McGlone’s, explicitly warn about **sharp interim drawdowns** even in bullish long‑term scenarios. [[48]](\n\nThe biggest disagreements in 2026 forecasts aren’t really about Bitcoin’s code or halving schedule — they’re about **interest rates, liquidity and regulation**. Make sure your own plan makes sense in **both** a dovish and a hawkish world.\n\nSome of the highest numbers come from venues that also promote presales, meme coins or high‑yield products in the same breath. Use those forecasts as **sentiment signals**, not as investment blueprints. [[49]](\n\nIf you’re a short‑term trader, the difference between 120k and 200k in 2026 matters far less than **next month’s volatility**. If you’re a long‑term allocator, you may care more about whether Bitcoin credibly reaches **multi‑hundred‑thousand levels by 2030** than whether it finishes 2026 at 110k or 150k. [[50]](\n\nAll of the forecasts above — from banks, crypto platforms, AI models and columnists — can be wrong. Bitcoin remains **highly volatile and speculative**. You should only invest money you can afford to lose and consider getting advice from a qualified financial professional before making major decisions.\n\n## 8. Bottom Line: What Does a “Realistic” Bitcoin 2026 Forecast Look Like?\n\n* **Floor risk:** Serious analysts see a non‑trivial chance that Bitcoin could revisit **$50,000–$80,000** in a harsh risk‑off environment. [[51]](\n\n* **Central tendency:** Many structured models and consensus tools cluster around a **six‑figure BTC in 2026**, often in the **$100k–$150k** neighbourhood. [[52]](\n\n* **Upside tail:** A smaller but vocal group of banks and analysts think policy, ETFs and state‑level accumulation could push Bitcoin toward **$200k–$300k** by 2026, with extreme outliers talking about **half a million**.

Her remarks come amid regulatory uncertainty, rising ETF adoption, and renewed debate over Bitcoin’s founding principles.\n\n* SEC officials call self-custody a fundamental right, while Congress delays the key crypto market structure bill to 2026.\n\n* Bitcoin holders shift to ETFs, driven by tax-friendly in-kind creations and simpler asset management choices.\n\n* Rising ETF adoption sparks debate as critics say moving away from self-custody weakens Bitcoin’s original purpose.\n\n* PlanB’s move to ETFs adds fuel to community concerns over growing reliance on third-party custodial services.\n\nPeirce, who also leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said on The Rollup podcast that holding one’s own assets should never be questioned in a nation built on personal freedom. According to her, [self-custody]( is a basic human right, and she expressed disbelief that Americans would be expected to rely on intermediaries to safeguard their assets.\n\nShe also stated that privacy should be standard in online financial activity rather than treated as a suspicious choice.\n\nHer comments come as the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act faces further delays. Senator Tim Scott confirmed that the bill, which addresses self-custody, AML rules, and asset taxonomy, has been pushed to 2026. Scott added that the broader effort aims to [empower everyday Americans]( in the growing digital economy. He also noted that lawmakers plan to present a bipartisan draft soon in hopes of delivering it to President Trump.\n\nDuring a June roundtable of the SEC Crypto Task Force, Commissioner Paul Atkins [voiced a similar position]( calling self-custody a core American value. His remarks reinforced Peirce’s stance at a time when industry behavior is shifting.\n\nRising interest in crypto investment vehicles is changing how long-term Bitcoin holders manage their coins. Many whales and early adopters are now moving assets into [exchange-traded funds]( motivated by tax advantages and simpler administration. Dr. Martin Hiesboeck of Uphold reported the first notable decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years.\n\n* Approval of in-kind ETF creations that avoid taxable events.\n\n* Preference for simpler asset management.\n\n* Growing comfort with regulated investment structures.\n\n* Reduced willingness to maintain private key security.\n\n* Influence of high-profile investors choosing ETFs.\n\nIn July, the SEC allowed in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs, enabling holders to exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares without triggering tax obligations tied to cash-settled products. Hiesboeck warned that this development moves the industry away from the long-standing “not your keys, not your coins” principle.\n\n[Sentiment in the Bitcoin community]( intensified after PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow model, revealed in February that he transferred his Bitcoin into ETFs to avoid the burden of managing private keys. His decision sparked strong reactions, with many arguing that surrendering custody contradicts Bitcoin’s purpose as a self-sovereign asset.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"\"Read to Earn\"\" program!

Instead, she said, privacy should be the default, not a sign of wrongdoing.\n\n“If you want to keep your transactions private, the assumption shouldn’t be that you’re doing something illegal,” she said. “It should be the opposite.”\n\nHer remarks arrive as uncertainty continues around US crypto legislation.\n\nAccording to Senator Tim Scott, the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act, a bill that addresses self-custody, anti-money laundering rules and the classification of digital assets, [has been delayed until 2026](\n\nThe lull has left the industry without a legal framework that directly addresses how Americans can legally hold and use digital assets.\n\nPeirce’s comments also come at a time when self-custody itself faces competition from Wall Street products.\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have made crypto easier to access for traditional investors, drawing some users away from holding coins directly in private wallets.\n\nDr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, said the industry is seeing the “first decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years,” as investors shift into ETFs for tax advantages and convenience.\n\nThe introduction of in-kind redemptions earlier this year allows ETF holders to swap crypto for shares without triggering a taxable event, a benefit that directly competes with personal wallets.\n\nThe debate intensified in February when analyst [PlanB disclosed that he had moved]( his Bitcoin into ETFs to avoid the stress of managing private keys.\n\nHe claimed that ETFs offer a convenient alternative, reducing the complexities and risks associated with holding private wallet keys.\n\nOne of the key reasons behind PlanB’s decision is the security challenge of managing private keys. “Not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind,” he stated.\n\nThe announcement sparked backlash from purists who see centralized custody as a betrayal of Bitcoin’s founding principles.\n\n* [[LIVE] Fed Payments Innovation Conference: Real-Time Updates as Federal Reserve Discusses Crypto, Stablecoins, and AI with Industry Leaders](\n\n* [XRP Price Prediction: UAE Just Approved Ripple’s Stablecoin – Can Arab Wealth Send XRP to $1,000?](\n\n* [XRP Price Prediction: ETF Inflows Aren’t Helping – Is Something Seriously Wrong With Ripple Right Now?](\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Turns Green Again – Is the Selling Finally Over?\n\nAt Cryptonews, we aim to make cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 understandable, and information available to everyone, no matter what level you are in your investment journey.

After hitting a record above **$126,000 in early October 2025**, BTC slid sharply in November, briefly dropping near **$80,000** before stabilising. [[1]](\n\nBy 30 November 2025, Bitcoin is trading just above **$91,000**, according to multiple market data providers and price analyses. [[2]](\n\nAgainst that volatile backdrop, **Bitcoin price forecasts for 2026 are wildly split**. Serious models and analysts are now calling for anything from **$50,000** at the low end to **$300,000+** — with some aggregated forecasts stretching as high as **$500,000**.\n\nThis article pulls together the latest **2026 Bitcoin price predictions**, the macro and policy drivers behind them, and a few grounded scenarios to help you interpret the noise. It’s **informational only**, not financial advice.\n\nBefore digging into forecasts, it helps to understand the setup.\n\n* **New all‑time high, then a harsh reset.** Research from YouHodler and other analysts places Bitcoin’s all‑time high around **$126,000–$126,200 in early October 2025**. [[3]](\n\n* **A 30%+ November drawdown.** The Economic Times reports that BTC dropped roughly **31% in November**, falling from the October peak toward **$82,000** amid hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric, rising yields and nearly **$2 billion in crypto liquidations**. [[4]](\n\n* **ETF-driven but choppy demand.** BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has exploded to about **$70+ billion in assets**, helping push total BlackRock Bitcoin ETF allocations near **$100 billion** and making them the firm’s biggest revenue driver — but November also saw more than **$2.3 billion** in outflows as prices fell. [[5]](\n\n* **Policy tailwinds in the US.** The Trump administration has leaned into Bitcoin: Standard Chartered notes that BTC first broke **$100,000** after his election, and the bank now projects aggressive upside as regulatory and accounting rules become friendlier. [[6]](\n\nAt the same time, **macro uncertainty is high**. In November, DL News highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs just had their worst month for outflows since February, while analysts fret about liquidity, AI-bubble risks in equities and a divided Federal Reserve. [[7]](\n\nIn short: Bitcoin enters the 2026 window **battle‑tested**, heavily owned by institutions and governments, but sensitive to interest rates, liquidity and risk appetite.\n\nTraditional finance has finally embraced making explicit multi‑year Bitcoin calls — and they don’t agree with each other at all.\n\n* **Pro‑crypto US policy** under President Trump, including a federal working group on digital assets and discussion of a national digital asset stockpile.

[[22]](\n\n+ A November 2025 feature asked ChatGPT to summarise existing 2026 BTC models. The article reports that published projections span from roughly **$99,000 on the low end** (InvestingHaven’s minimum) to about **$228,000** (an optimistic model dubbed Orange Standard), with several mid‑range forecasts around **$120,000–$165,000**.

[[27]](\n\n* A Forbes contributor (in a paywalled piece) framed **2026 as a year of “breaking cycles”**, arguing that Bitcoin and stablecoins are increasingly tied to institutional behaviour, cross‑border payments and state‑level adoption rather than retail mania alone.

[[31]](\n\n+ Futures markets currently price a high probability of cuts in 2026 — but policymakers are openly divided on timing and magnitude. [[32]](\n\n+ CryptoNews reports on concerns from **Robert Kiyosaki** and others about a “global liquidity reset” driven by Japan’s changing fiscal stance and the unwinding of leveraged yen carry trades, which could temporarily hurt risk assets including BTC.

These are not my predictions, just a way to organise what the market is saying.\n\n* Warnings about **ETF outflows**, liquidity drains and AI‑bubble fallout from multiple market commentators. [[36]](\n\n* **No sustained Fed easing**; rates stay high or cut only modestly.\n\n* ETFs flip from net buyers to **persistent net sellers**.\n\n* Bitcoin behaves more like a **high‑beta tech stock**, underperforming gold and sovereign bonds.\n\n* The 2024–26 cycle rhymes with **2017–2018**, with a long, grinding comedown from the 2025 peak.\n\nIn this scenario, Bitcoin is still far above its 2022 lows, but many of the six‑figure forecasts prove **too optimistic, too soon**.\n\n* Nasdaq / GOBankingRates’ summary of models between roughly **$99k and $228k**, with several mid‑range projections. [[40]](\n\n* **Macro softens gradually**: rates drift lower, but no huge money‑printing spree.\n\n* Spot ETFs keep a **net‑positive but choppy** flow profile, with periods of outflows offset by renewed interest. [[41]](\n\n* Bitcoin carves out a broad **six‑figure trading range**, with periodic spikes above 150k and sharp pullbacks, but no structural breakdown below prior cycle highs for long.\n\n* The 2024 halving still matters, but the peak doesn’t arrive in a clean 12–18 month window — price action is choppier and more drawn‑out.\n\nFor long‑term holders, this scenario still represents **solid real returns**, but the path is noisy enough that **leverage and over‑sizing can be dangerous**.\n\n* Bernstein’s extended‑cycle view, with a potential move toward **$200,000** as ETFs and a federal Bitcoin reserve reshape demand. [[43]](\n\n* YouHodler and other bullish long‑term models that see **$170k+** in the second half of the decade, with upside to **$250k–$700k by 2030** in optimistic scenarios. [[44]](\n\n* CryptoSlate’s compilation of public forecasts that stretches the **2026 high‑end up to about $500,000** in extreme cases. [[45]](\n\n* **Aggressive global ETF and institutional adoption**; pension funds, insurers and sovereign wealth funds make Bitcoin a standard allocation. [[46]](\n\n* The **US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** concept gains traction; paying taxes in BTC and similar policies encourage governments to accumulate rather than sell. [[47]](\n\n* Gold stagnates or loses mindshare as “digital gold” becomes a mainstream thesis.\n\n* Halving plus policy plus macro relief create **compounding tailwinds**, driving a parabolic leg that pushes BTC well beyond 150k – potentially into the Standard Chartered 300k zone.\n\nThis outcome is **not impossible** — but it requires **multiple favourable forces to line up at once**, with surprisingly few policy or macro shocks along the way.\n\nIf you’re reading Bitcoin price predictions for 2026, you’re probably thinking about **positioning**. A few practical ways to treat these forecasts as tools, not gospel:\n\nNotice how serious forecasters mostly give **bands** (e.g. $100k–$190k), not precise ticks. Treat any 2026 number as a **zone of possibility**, not a promise.\n\nA model saying “BTC could be 150k in 2026” doesn’t tell you whether it visits **50k first**. Many 2026 outlooks, including Kiyosaki’s and McGlone’s, explicitly warn about **sharp interim drawdowns** even in bullish long‑term scenarios. [[48]](\n\nThe biggest disagreements in 2026 forecasts aren’t really about Bitcoin’s code or halving schedule — they’re about **interest rates, liquidity and regulation**. Make sure your own plan makes sense in **both** a dovish and a hawkish world.\n\nSome of the highest numbers come from venues that also promote presales, meme coins or high‑yield products in the same breath. Use those forecasts as **sentiment signals**, not as investment blueprints. [[49]](\n\nIf you’re a short‑term trader, the difference between 120k and 200k in 2026 matters far less than **next month’s volatility**. If you’re a long‑term allocator, you may care more about whether Bitcoin credibly reaches **multi‑hundred‑thousand levels by 2030** than whether it finishes 2026 at 110k or 150k. [[50]](\n\nAll of the forecasts above — from banks, crypto platforms, AI models and columnists — can be wrong. Bitcoin remains **highly volatile and speculative**. You should only invest money you can afford to lose and consider getting advice from a qualified financial professional before making major decisions.\n\n## 8. Bottom Line: What Does a “Realistic” Bitcoin 2026 Forecast Look Like?\n\n* **Floor risk:** Serious analysts see a non‑trivial chance that Bitcoin could revisit **$50,000–$80,000** in a harsh risk‑off environment. [[51]](\n\n* **Central tendency:** Many structured models and consensus tools cluster around a **six‑figure BTC in 2026**, often in the **$100k–$150k** neighbourhood. [[52]](\n\n* **Upside tail:** A smaller but vocal group of banks and analysts think policy, ETFs and state‑level accumulation could push Bitcoin toward **$200k–$300k** by 2026, with extreme outliers talking about **half a million**. [[53]](\n\nNo one *knows* which path will win. What we can say is that **2026 is shaping up to be one of the most consequential years in Bitcoin’s short history** — a year where halving‑cycle tradition collides with ETF‑driven institutionalisation and rapidly shifting global monetary policy.\n\nIf you decide to be part of that story, make sure your plan is built for **both** the 50k winter **and** the 300k summer.\n\n1.

According to their recent report on USDT, Tether’s reserves have shifted toward more volatile holdings over the past year. These perceived riskier assets, such as bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate bonds, now make up 24% of the reserve mix, up from 17% in 2024.\n\nOne of S&P’s sharpest criticisms in its downgrade of USDT lies in its growing reliance on bitcoin in particular as a reserve asset, now comprising 5.6% of the backing, which is well above the 3.9% reserve buffer Tether itself flagged in its latest quarterly report ([PDF]( According to S&P, this exposure amplifies risks tied to bitcoin’s notorious volatility.\n\nS&P also sees serious issues regarding transparency at Tether, as the stablecoin issuer’s attestations offer little more than high-level snapshots, with zero granularity on who holds these assets, how they’re custodied, or what counterparties lurk in the shadows.\n\nThat said, Tether’s reserves still lean heavily on short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, accounting for 75% of the reserves. Despite the alleged red flags from S&P, USDT has held its $1 peg through many of crypto’s wild rides over the years, notably handling billions in redemptions without a hitch during the [collapse of crypto exchange FTX](\n\nA Tether spokesperson told *Reuters* the company “strongly disagrees” with S&P’s assessment, which uses an outdated model that ignores USDT’s track record and role as vital infrastructure in emerging markets.\n\n[Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino went further on X]( framing the downgrade as a badge of honor: Tether “wears S&P’s loathing with pride,” thriving as an “overcapitalized” outsider to a flawed legacy system. “The classical rating models built for legacy financial institutions, historically led private and institutional investors to invest their wealth into companies that despite being attributed investment grade ratings collapsed,” Ardoino added.\n\n[In another post]( Ardoino pointed to Tether’s latest attestation [announcement]( where the company also claimed an excess reserve buffer approaching $30 billion; however, this is not explicitly part of USDT’s current reserves.\n\n# Trust S&P or Trust Bitcoin?\n\nIn another post, Ardoino referenced S&P’s failures during the 2008 financial crisis, which were portrayed by a blind woman in the associated film The Big Short. [S&P paid a $1.375 billion settlement]( in a related case with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding allegations that the ratings agency had defrauded investors with its ratings of financial products in the lead up to the housing crisis. Notably, Bitcoin itself was originally launched in January 2009, almost as a direct response to the collapse of trust involved in the financial crisis.\n\nJust weeks before scrutinizing Tether, [S&P also slapped a speculative ‘B-‘ issuer credit rating on bitcoin treasury company Strategy]( highlighting the firm’s $80 billion-plus bitcoin hoard as a vulnerability that could cripple debt payments amid market plunges. The agency’s outlook stays stable for now, but it flags Strategy’s negative cash flow and bitcoin concentration as red flags, much like the volatility risks baked into USDT’s reserves.\n\nWhile S&P sees issues with Tether and Strategy using bitcoin as a reserve asset, many other well-known institutions, such as [the Harvard University Endowment]( and [the state of Texas]( are buying the crypto asset to hold for the long term and find it to be useful as an apolitical, digital store of value.\n\nIt should also be noted that S&P is largely focused on stablecoin issuers’ ability to redeem tokens for dollars in their assessments, so an asset like USDT where the issuer is operating more like a bank issuing its own private currency doesn’t necessarily fit the mold perfectly. In other words, USDT may be viewed negatively by many in the traditional financial system because it is operating on a new standard built on bitcoin rather than the traditional, dollar-based system.\n\n[### U.S. Bank Calls Ability to Freeze Stablecoins ‘Appealing’ as Crypto Has Completely Lost the Plot\n\nThe endowment dramatically increased its holdings of a spot bitcoin ETF since its previous such report.](\",0.4\nbitcoin,Top Cryptocurrency Stocks To Add to Your Watchlist – November 28th - Defense World,https://www.defenseworld.net/2025/11/30/top-cryptocurrency-stocks-to-add-to-your-watchlist-november-28th.html,\"[Share on Twitter]( \"\"Share on Twitter\"\") [Share on Facebook]( \"\"Share on Facebook\"\") [Share on LinkedIn]( \"\"Share on LinkedIn\"\") [Share on Stocktwits]( \"\"Share on Stocktwits\"\")\n\nBitfarms, Galaxy Digital, HIVE Digital Technologies, Soluna, and Digi Power X are the five Cryptocurrency stocks to watch today, according to MarketBeat’s stock screener tool. “Cryptocurrency stocks” refers to shares of publicly traded companies whose business activities or balance sheets are directly tied to cryptocurrencies — for example, crypto miners, exchanges, wallet or blockchain software providers, or firms that hold large amounts of Bitcoin or other tokens.

In the past five years, the leading cryptocurrency has soared 409% (as of Nov. 26).\n\nInvestors might be inclined to take a chance on Bitcoin on the recent dip. But where will this digital asset be in 2030?\n\nBitcoin has had a monster rise over the past decade. However, investors shouldn't extrapolate those gains going forward. The reasonable outlook is to expect lower returns, since the asset is maturing.\n\nThat being said, it wouldn't be surprising to see Bitcoin's price triple by the end of 2030. To do this, it would need togenerate a robust[compound annual rate of return]( of 25%. This would surely outperform the stock market by a wide margin.\n\nBitcoin's best trait is that it has a hard supply cap of 21 million units. This scarcity makes it a compelling asset to own, particularly as fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, constantly lose[purchasing power]( over time.\n\nThe current regulatory backdrop works to Bitcoin's benefit as well, making it easier for companies to build related products and services and for investors to access the crypto.\n\nBitcoin currently trades at around $88,000. In five years, it's not out of reach for it to trade around the $270,000 mark, if the bull run continues.

Direct wallets incur a 2% conversion fee when making purchases. No preloading required.***\n\nTruther will transform cryptos in Latin America. During the Blockchain conference in Brazil, the company declared its collaboration with Visa. The card will have a debut launch in El Salvador.\n\nThe product is aimed at travelers and crypto users who want useful solutions. Old-fashioned crypto cards either need to be preloaded or custodial. The innovation of Truther does away with these two requirements altogether.\n\n**You might also like:** [BTC News: El Salvador Makes Largest-Ever Bitcoin Buy With 1,090 BTC Addition](\n\n[CoinDesk]( states that the card deducts USDT at the point of purchase. In the case of the interview at the conference, founder Rocelo Lopes described the process. The users keep full control over their personal wallets.\n\nYou do not charge the card in advance, Lopes said. A 30 euros hotel bill will automatically convert to USDT. The exchange is real-time and has no delays.\n\nThe card currently uses Polygon blockchain infrastructure. Truther intends to migrate to the Liquid network, where privacy is better. Users do not convert crypto into fiat.\n\nAll conversions of currency attract a charge of 2%. Brazilian users are exempt from the IOF tax. All users can access the card after launching.\n\nTruther already handles $40 million in daily volume of transactions. [USDT]( is linked to the PIX payment system in Brazil through the company. Stablecoin payouts to creators and workers were recently piloted by Visa.\n\nThe bitcoin legal tender status in El Salvador presents a perfect experimental environment. Its introduction is succeeded by expansion plans to other parts of Latin America. Other markets will be accessed gradually.\n\nSwapix API by Truther supports real-time crypto-to-fiat transfers. The next in the queue is Argentina. Subsequent rollouts are to Mexico, Colombia, and Russia.\n\nThe choice of the market is based on the availability of a 24/7 payment infrastructure. The support of QR code transactions is vital to operations. [Market]( preparedness is determined by the real-time settlement capabilities.\n\nThe self-custody wallet accepts BTC and USDT at the moment. The Brazilian real-pegged stablecoin Truther is based on Liquid. There are more local integrations of stablecoins in early 2025.\n\nTether Gold will enter the wallet portfolio. A token pegged to Argentine pesos enters development phases. Users are able to use crypto through QR codes.\n\nThere are no network gas fees as recipients obtain stablecoins. The capability increases the ease of use in daily transactions. Conventional banks are considering stablecoin platform integration.\n\nLopes refused to provide any specific details of the bank partnerships. His anticipations are a tripling of stablecoin volumes in twelve months. Conventional financial institutions are fueling the expansion of the ecosystem.\n\n### [XRP News: XRP Set for 10x Rally? 2017 Pattern Repeats]( \"\"XRP News: XRP Set for 10x Rally? 2017 Pattern Repeats\"\")\n\n### [Crypto News: a16z Issues Personal Safety Guidelines Amid Rising Crypto Crime]( \"\"Crypto News: a16z Issues Personal Safety Guidelines Amid Rising Crypto Crime\"\")\n\n### [XRP News: CoinShares Abandons $870M XRP and SOL ETF Race]( \"\"XRP News: CoinShares Abandons $870M XRP and SOL ETF Race\"\")\n\nLiveBitcoinNews is a leading online platform dedicated to providing the latest news and insights about Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.

Her remarks come amid regulatory uncertainty, rising ETF adoption, and renewed debate over Bitcoin’s founding principles.\n\n* SEC officials call self-custody a fundamental right, while Congress delays the key crypto market structure bill to 2026.\n\n* Bitcoin holders shift to ETFs, driven by tax-friendly in-kind creations and simpler asset management choices.\n\n* Rising ETF adoption sparks debate as critics say moving away from self-custody weakens Bitcoin’s original purpose.\n\n* PlanB’s move to ETFs adds fuel to community concerns over growing reliance on third-party custodial services.\n\nPeirce, who also leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said on The Rollup podcast that holding one’s own assets should never be questioned in a nation built on personal freedom. According to her, [self-custody]( is a basic human right, and she expressed disbelief that Americans would be expected to rely on intermediaries to safeguard their assets.\n\nShe also stated that privacy should be standard in online financial activity rather than treated as a suspicious choice.\n\nHer comments come as the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act faces further delays. Senator Tim Scott confirmed that the bill, which addresses self-custody, AML rules, and asset taxonomy, has been pushed to 2026. Scott added that the broader effort aims to [empower everyday Americans]( in the growing digital economy. He also noted that lawmakers plan to present a bipartisan draft soon in hopes of delivering it to President Trump.\n\nDuring a June roundtable of the SEC Crypto Task Force, Commissioner Paul Atkins [voiced a similar position]( calling self-custody a core American value. His remarks reinforced Peirce’s stance at a time when industry behavior is shifting.\n\nRising interest in crypto investment vehicles is changing how long-term Bitcoin holders manage their coins. Many whales and early adopters are now moving assets into [exchange-traded funds]( motivated by tax advantages and simpler administration. Dr. Martin Hiesboeck of Uphold reported the first notable decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years.\n\n* Approval of in-kind ETF creations that avoid taxable events.\n\n* Preference for simpler asset management.\n\n* Growing comfort with regulated investment structures.\n\n* Reduced willingness to maintain private key security.\n\n* Influence of high-profile investors choosing ETFs.\n\nIn July, the SEC allowed in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs, enabling holders to exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares without triggering tax obligations tied to cash-settled products. Hiesboeck warned that this development moves the industry away from the long-standing “not your keys, not your coins” principle.\n\n[Sentiment in the Bitcoin community]( intensified after PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow model, revealed in February that he transferred his Bitcoin into ETFs to avoid the burden of managing private keys. His decision sparked strong reactions, with many arguing that surrendering custody contradicts Bitcoin’s purpose as a self-sovereign asset.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"\"Read to Earn\"\" program!

Instead, she said, privacy should be the default, not a sign of wrongdoing.\n\n“If you want to keep your transactions private, the assumption shouldn’t be that you’re doing something illegal,” she said. “It should be the opposite.”\n\nHer remarks arrive as uncertainty continues around US crypto legislation.\n\nAccording to Senator Tim Scott, the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act, a bill that addresses self-custody, anti-money laundering rules and the classification of digital assets, [has been delayed until 2026](\n\nThe lull has left the industry without a legal framework that directly addresses how Americans can legally hold and use digital assets.\n\nPeirce’s comments also come at a time when self-custody itself faces competition from Wall Street products.\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have made crypto easier to access for traditional investors, drawing some users away from holding coins directly in private wallets.\n\nDr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, said the industry is seeing the “first decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years,” as investors shift into ETFs for tax advantages and convenience.\n\nThe introduction of in-kind redemptions earlier this year allows ETF holders to swap crypto for shares without triggering a taxable event, a benefit that directly competes with personal wallets.\n\nThe debate intensified in February when analyst [PlanB disclosed that he had moved]( his Bitcoin into ETFs to avoid the stress of managing private keys.\n\nHe claimed that ETFs offer a convenient alternative, reducing the complexities and risks associated with holding private wallet keys.\n\nOne of the key reasons behind PlanB’s decision is the security challenge of managing private keys. “Not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind,” he stated.\n\nThe announcement sparked backlash from purists who see centralized custody as a betrayal of Bitcoin’s founding principles.\n\n* [[LIVE] Fed Payments Innovation Conference: Real-Time Updates as Federal Reserve Discusses Crypto, Stablecoins, and AI with Industry Leaders](\n\n* [XRP Price Prediction: UAE Just Approved Ripple’s Stablecoin – Can Arab Wealth Send XRP to $1,000?](\n\n* [XRP Price Prediction: ETF Inflows Aren’t Helping – Is Something Seriously Wrong With Ripple Right Now?](\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Turns Green Again – Is the Selling Finally Over?\n\nAt Cryptonews, we aim to make cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 understandable, and information available to everyone, no matter what level you are in your investment journey.

According to their recent report on USDT, Tether’s reserves have shifted toward more volatile holdings over the past year. These perceived riskier assets, such as bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate bonds, now make up 24% of the reserve mix, up from 17% in 2024.\n\nOne of S&P’s sharpest criticisms in its downgrade of USDT lies in its growing reliance on bitcoin in particular as a reserve asset, now comprising 5.6% of the backing, which is well above the 3.9% reserve buffer Tether itself flagged in its latest quarterly report ([PDF]( According to S&P, this exposure amplifies risks tied to bitcoin’s notorious volatility.\n\nS&P also sees serious issues regarding transparency at Tether, as the stablecoin issuer’s attestations offer little more than high-level snapshots, with zero granularity on who holds these assets, how they’re custodied, or what counterparties lurk in the shadows.\n\nThat said, Tether’s reserves still lean heavily on short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, accounting for 75% of the reserves. Despite the alleged red flags from S&P, USDT has held its $1 peg through many of crypto’s wild rides over the years, notably handling billions in redemptions without a hitch during the [collapse of crypto exchange FTX](\n\nA Tether spokesperson told *Reuters* the company “strongly disagrees” with S&P’s assessment, which uses an outdated model that ignores USDT’s track record and role as vital infrastructure in emerging markets.\n\n[Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino went further on X]( framing the downgrade as a badge of honor: Tether “wears S&P’s loathing with pride,” thriving as an “overcapitalized” outsider to a flawed legacy system. “The classical rating models built for legacy financial institutions, historically led private and institutional investors to invest their wealth into companies that despite being attributed investment grade ratings collapsed,” Ardoino added.\n\n[In another post]( Ardoino pointed to Tether’s latest attestation [announcement]( where the company also claimed an excess reserve buffer approaching $30 billion; however, this is not explicitly part of USDT’s current reserves.\n\n# Trust S&P or Trust Bitcoin?\n\nIn another post, Ardoino referenced S&P’s failures during the 2008 financial crisis, which were portrayed by a blind woman in the associated film The Big Short. [S&P paid a $1.375 billion settlement]( in a related case with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding allegations that the ratings agency had defrauded investors with its ratings of financial products in the lead up to the housing crisis. Notably, Bitcoin itself was originally launched in January 2009, almost as a direct response to the collapse of trust involved in the financial crisis.\n\nJust weeks before scrutinizing Tether, [S&P also slapped a speculative ‘B-‘ issuer credit rating on bitcoin treasury company Strategy]( highlighting the firm’s $80 billion-plus bitcoin hoard as a vulnerability that could cripple debt payments amid market plunges. The agency’s outlook stays stable for now, but it flags Strategy’s negative cash flow and bitcoin concentration as red flags, much like the volatility risks baked into USDT’s reserves.\n\nWhile S&P sees issues with Tether and Strategy using bitcoin as a reserve asset, many other well-known institutions, such as [the Harvard University Endowment]( and [the state of Texas]( are buying the crypto asset to hold for the long term and find it to be useful as an apolitical, digital store of value.\n\nIt should also be noted that S&P is largely focused on stablecoin issuers’ ability to redeem tokens for dollars in their assessments, so an asset like USDT where the issuer is operating more like a bank issuing its own private currency doesn’t necessarily fit the mold perfectly. In other words, USDT may be viewed negatively by many in the traditional financial system because it is operating on a new standard built on bitcoin rather than the traditional, dollar-based system.\n\n[### U.S. Bank Calls Ability to Freeze Stablecoins ‘Appealing’ as Crypto Has Completely Lost the Plot\n\nThe endowment dramatically increased its holdings of a spot bitcoin ETF since its previous such report.](\",0.4\nbitcoin,Market News: El Salvador Gets First Self-Custody USDT Visa Card - Live Bitcoin News,https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/market-news-el-salvador-gets-first-self-custody-usdt-visa-card/,\"[Facebook]( \"\"Facebook\"\")     [Linkedin]( \"\"Linkedin\"\")     [RSS]( \"\"RSS\"\")     [Telegram]( \"\"Telegram\"\")     [Twitter]( \"\"Twitter\"\")\n\nWe participate in marketing programs, our editorial content is not influenced by any commissions.

After hitting a record above **$126,000 in early October 2025**, BTC slid sharply in November, briefly dropping near **$80,000** before stabilising. [[1]](\n\nBy 30 November 2025, Bitcoin is trading just above **$91,000**, according to multiple market data providers and price analyses. [[2]](\n\nAgainst that volatile backdrop, **Bitcoin price forecasts for 2026 are wildly split**. Serious models and analysts are now calling for anything from **$50,000** at the low end to **$300,000+** — with some aggregated forecasts stretching as high as **$500,000**.\n\nThis article pulls together the latest **2026 Bitcoin price predictions**, the macro and policy drivers behind them, and a few grounded scenarios to help you interpret the noise. It’s **informational only**, not financial advice.\n\nBefore digging into forecasts, it helps to understand the setup.\n\n* **New all‑time high, then a harsh reset.** Research from YouHodler and other analysts places Bitcoin’s all‑time high around **$126,000–$126,200 in early October 2025**. [[3]](\n\n* **A 30%+ November drawdown.** The Economic Times reports that BTC dropped roughly **31% in November**, falling from the October peak toward **$82,000** amid hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric, rising yields and nearly **$2 billion in crypto liquidations**. [[4]](\n\n* **ETF-driven but choppy demand.** BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has exploded to about **$70+ billion in assets**, helping push total BlackRock Bitcoin ETF allocations near **$100 billion** and making them the firm’s biggest revenue driver — but November also saw more than **$2.3 billion** in outflows as prices fell. [[5]](\n\n* **Policy tailwinds in the US.** The Trump administration has leaned into Bitcoin: Standard Chartered notes that BTC first broke **$100,000** after his election, and the bank now projects aggressive upside as regulatory and accounting rules become friendlier. [[6]](\n\nAt the same time, **macro uncertainty is high**. In November, DL News highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs just had their worst month for outflows since February, while analysts fret about liquidity, AI-bubble risks in equities and a divided Federal Reserve. [[7]](\n\nIn short: Bitcoin enters the 2026 window **battle‑tested**, heavily owned by institutions and governments, but sensitive to interest rates, liquidity and risk appetite.\n\nTraditional finance has finally embraced making explicit multi‑year Bitcoin calls — and they don’t agree with each other at all.\n\n* **Pro‑crypto US policy** under President Trump, including a federal working group on digital assets and discussion of a national digital asset stockpile. [[9]](\n\n* **ETFs unleashing pent‑up institutional demand**, with tens of billions flowing into spot products. [[10]](\n\n* **Falling volatility**, making BTC more acceptable as an institutional portfolio allocation alongside gold.\n\n### Bernstein / MarketWatch: Up to ~$200,000 on an “extended cycle”\n\n* The **current bull run, which began in 2023, could stretch through 2026 and peak in 2027**.\n\n* Bitcoin could climb toward **$200,000 within about a year**, helped by US pro‑crypto policies (including a proposed federal Bitcoin reserve) and sustained ETF adoption. [[11]](\n\nThis view effectively argues that the classic four‑year Bitcoin cycle may **“break” or lengthen** as policy and institutional flows matter more than simple halving math.\n\nOn the other side, Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist **Mike McGlone** has become a high‑profile bear:\n\n* He argues Bitcoin could **drop around 40%** from autumn levels and trade near **$50,000 in 2026** — roughly 60% below its $126k high. [[12]](\n\n* In a widely cited LinkedIn post, he framed the dilemma as **“Bitcoin $50,000 or $150,000 in 2026?”** and said his **bias is toward $50,000**, especially if the S&P 500 suffers a rare third down year in this cycle. [[13]](\n\n* **Gold outperforming** while crude oil and stocks wobble encourages investors to de‑risk away from volatile assets like BTC. [[14]](\n\n* **ETF outflows and liquidity stress** could deepen, mirroring the 2018 post‑bubble crash.\n\nJPMorgan hasn’t published a headline‑grabbing 2026 BTC price target, but its mining sector research gives clues:\n\n* The bank recently **upgraded selected miners** such as Cipher Mining and CleanSpark, lifting their **December 2026**price targets on expectations that high‑performance computing and AI workloads will support miner economics even if BTC prices stay under pressure. [[15]](\n\n* The Economic Times highlights their modelling as consistent with a **crypto “rebound” into 2026**, even after November’s sharp pullback. [[16]](\n\nThe takeaway: **Big banks are split** between extremely bullish trajectories (200k–300k) and more cautious or even bearish paths (~50k). None of them treat current levels near 90k as a comfortable equilibrium.\n\nCrypto‑native platforms and research shops tend to produce **structured, year‑by‑year tables**. While they’re not independent investment advice, they help map out the current sentiment.\n\n+ **2026 range: $100,000–$189,900** (updated November 2025).\n\n+ They describe this as a “conservative” range and see a broader long‑term path toward **$300,000 by 2030** if adoption continues. [[17]](\n\n+ FAQ section suggests Bitcoin could reach about **$173,672 by end‑2026**, assuming constructive long‑term trends. [[19]](\n\n+ Based on inputs from Binance users, the 2026 BTC value is projected around **$96,290.96** — essentially a modest gain from today. [[20]](\n\n+ Under a simple model assuming BTC appreciates **5% per year**, Kraken’s calculator produces a **2026 price of about $95,939.55** and around **$189,953 by 2040**. [[21]](\n\n+ Kraken explicitly notes this isn’t a forecast but a math exercise based on user‑chosen growth rates.\n\n+ A late‑September analysis collated public forecasts and found **2026 price targets ranging roughly from $60,000 to $500,000**, with a **median near $201,000** when outliers are included. [[22]](\n\n+ A November 2025 feature asked ChatGPT to summarise existing 2026 BTC models. The article reports that published projections span from roughly **$99,000 on the low end** (InvestingHaven’s minimum) to about **$228,000** (an optimistic model dubbed Orange Standard), with several mid‑range forecasts around **$120,000–$165,000**. [[23]](\n\n> **Most crypto‑oriented forecasts cluster around a six‑figure BTC price in 2026**, typically between **$100,000 and $200,000**, assuming the current cycle doesn’t completely break down.\n\nAt the same time, tools from Binance and Kraken show that **small changes in assumed growth rates** dramatically shift these numbers — a reminder that many “forecasts” are really **parameter‑driven scenarios**, not crystal balls.\n\nNumbers aside, 2026 Bitcoin forecasts hinge on a few powerful themes.\n\n* BlackRock’s **IBIT** and its Brazil‑listed cousin have reached **around $100 billion in combined allocations** and now generate more revenue for the firm than long‑standing legacy ETFs. [[24]](\n\n* IBIT alone holds roughly **3.9% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply**, according to ZyCrypto’s reporting, underscoring how much of BTC’s float is now locked inside regulated vehicles. [[25]](\n\n* Continued **net inflows** into spot ETFs.\n\n* More jurisdictions (and potentially new products like leveraged, options‑based or yield ETFs) widening access.\n\n* Liquidity draining from risk assets if central banks stay tighter for longer.\n\n### 4.2 Halving cycles vs. “breaking the cycle”\n\nBitcoin’s **fourth halving** in 2024 cut new supply again, and historically, BTC has peaked **12–18 months after** a halving. Classic cycle models would therefore expect a major top sometime in **late 2025 or early 2026**.\n\n* Bernstein’s research (via MarketWatch) suggests the current bull run could **extend into 2026 and even 2027**, driven by policy and ETF demand, not just halving math. [[27]](\n\n* A Forbes contributor (in a paywalled piece) framed **2026 as a year of “breaking cycles”**, arguing that Bitcoin and stablecoins are increasingly tied to institutional behaviour, cross‑border payments and state‑level adoption rather than retail mania alone. [[28]](\n\nIf they’re right, **2026 could be more like the middle of a super‑cycle** than the tail end of the usual four‑year pattern.\n\n* Standard Chartered ties its aggressive BTC projections directly to **Trump‑era pro‑crypto moves**, including looser accounting rules and a friendlier regulatory framework. [[29]](\n\n* A separate DL News report describes the **“Bitcoin for America Act”**, a bill from Representative Warren Davidson that would allow Americans to **pay federal income taxes in Bitcoin**, with the proceeds flowing into a **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** now estimated around **$16 billion**. [[30]](\n\n> The idea that **nation‑states will compete to accumulate Bitcoin** is moving from Twitter meme to serious policy discussion — and that’s explicitly built into some of the higher 2026 forecasts.\n\nEven the best Bitcoin models crumble if the macro backdrop swings hard. Analysts watching 2026 point to several key variables:\n\n+ DL News notes that some Russian market experts see **no full Bitcoin recovery before spring 2026** if the Fed doesn’t ease policy. [[31]](\n\n+ Futures markets currently price a high probability of cuts in 2026 — but policymakers are openly divided on timing and magnitude. [[32]](\n\n+ CryptoNews reports on concerns from **Robert Kiyosaki** and others about a “global liquidity reset” driven by Japan’s changing fiscal stance and the unwinding of leveraged yen carry trades, which could temporarily hurt risk assets including BTC. [[33]](\n\n+ DL News links recent crypto drawdowns to equity volatility as investors question whether massive AI capex will pay off, pulling capital from high‑beta assets like Bitcoin. [[34]](\n\n* **2020–2021:** Aggressive easing, booming liquidity and tech optimism → most 200k–300k Bitcoin scenarios look more plausible.\n\n* **2018 or 2022:** Sticky inflation, balance‑sheet tightening and risk‑off sentiment → the more pessimistic 50k–80k paths come into play.\n\nForecasts are really just **different assumptions about that macro dice roll**.\n\nPulling all this together, you can group the current 2026 Bitcoin forecasts into three broad bands. These are not my predictions, just a way to organise what the market is saying.\n\n* Warnings about **ETF outflows**, liquidity drains and AI‑bubble fallout from multiple market commentators. [[36]](\n\n* **No sustained Fed easing**; rates stay high or cut only modestly.\n\n* ETFs flip from net buyers to **persistent net sellers**.\n\n* Bitcoin behaves more like a **high‑beta tech stock**, underperforming gold and sovereign bonds.\n\n* The 2024–26 cycle rhymes with **2017–2018**, with a long, grinding comedown from the 2025 peak.\n\nIn this scenario, Bitcoin is still far above its 2022 lows, but many of the six‑figure forecasts prove **too optimistic, too soon**.\n\n* Nasdaq / GOBankingRates’ summary of models between roughly **$99k and $228k**, with several mid‑range projections. [[40]](\n\n* **Macro softens gradually**: rates drift lower, but no huge money‑printing spree.\n\n* Spot ETFs keep a **net‑positive but choppy** flow profile, with periods of outflows offset by renewed interest. [[41]](\n\n* Bitcoin carves out a broad **six‑figure trading range**, with periodic spikes above 150k and sharp pullbacks, but no structural breakdown below prior cycle highs for long.\n\n* The 2024 halving still matters, but the peak doesn’t arrive in a clean 12–18 month window — price action is choppier and more drawn‑out.\n\nFor long‑term holders, this scenario still represents **solid real returns**, but the path is noisy enough that **leverage and over‑sizing can be dangerous**.\n\n* Bernstein’s extended‑cycle view, with a potential move toward **$200,000** as ETFs and a federal Bitcoin reserve reshape demand. [[43]](\n\n* YouHodler and other bullish long‑term models that see **$170k+** in the second half of the decade, with upside to **$250k–$700k by 2030** in optimistic scenarios. [[44]](\n\n* CryptoSlate’s compilation of public forecasts that stretches the **2026 high‑end up to about $500,000** in extreme cases. [[45]](\n\n* **Aggressive global ETF and institutional adoption**; pension funds, insurers and sovereign wealth funds make Bitcoin a standard allocation. [[46]](\n\n* The **US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** concept gains traction; paying taxes in BTC and similar policies encourage governments to accumulate rather than sell. [[47]](\n\n* Gold stagnates or loses mindshare as “digital gold” becomes a mainstream thesis.\n\n* Halving plus policy plus macro relief create **compounding tailwinds**, driving a parabolic leg that pushes BTC well beyond 150k – potentially into the Standard Chartered 300k zone.\n\nThis outcome is **not impossible** — but it requires **multiple favourable forces to line up at once**, with surprisingly few policy or macro shocks along the way.\n\nIf you’re reading Bitcoin price predictions for 2026, you’re probably thinking about **positioning**. A few practical ways to treat these forecasts as tools, not gospel:\n\nNotice how serious forecasters mostly give **bands** (e.g. $100k–$190k), not precise ticks. Treat any 2026 number as a **zone of possibility**, not a promise.\n\nA model saying “BTC could be 150k in 2026” doesn’t tell you whether it visits **50k first**. Many 2026 outlooks, including Kiyosaki’s and McGlone’s, explicitly warn about **sharp interim drawdowns** even in bullish long‑term scenarios. [[48]](\n\nThe biggest disagreements in 2026 forecasts aren’t really about Bitcoin’s code or halving schedule — they’re about **interest rates, liquidity and regulation**. Make sure your own plan makes sense in **both** a dovish and a hawkish world.\n\nSome of the highest numbers come from venues that also promote presales, meme coins or high‑yield products in the same breath. Use those forecasts as **sentiment signals**, not as investment blueprints. [[49]](\n\nIf you’re a short‑term trader, the difference between 120k and 200k in 2026 matters far less than **next month’s volatility**. If you’re a long‑term allocator, you may care more about whether Bitcoin credibly reaches **multi‑hundred‑thousand levels by 2030** than whether it finishes 2026 at 110k or 150k. [[50]](\n\nAll of the forecasts above — from banks, crypto platforms, AI models and columnists — can be wrong. Bitcoin remains **highly volatile and speculative**. You should only invest money you can afford to lose and consider getting advice from a qualified financial professional before making major decisions.\n\n## 8. Bottom Line: What Does a “Realistic” Bitcoin 2026 Forecast Look Like?\n\n* **Floor risk:** Serious analysts see a non‑trivial chance that Bitcoin could revisit **$50,000–$80,000** in a harsh risk‑off environment. [[51]](\n\n* **Central tendency:** Many structured models and consensus tools cluster around a **six‑figure BTC in 2026**, often in the **$100k–$150k** neighbourhood. [[52]](\n\n* **Upside tail:** A smaller but vocal group of banks and analysts think policy, ETFs and state‑level accumulation could push Bitcoin toward **$200k–$300k** by 2026, with extreme outliers talking about **half a million**. [[53]](\n\nNo one *knows* which path will win. What we can say is that **2026 is shaping up to be one of the most consequential years in Bitcoin’s short history** — a year where halving‑cycle tradition collides with ETF‑driven institutionalisation and rapidly shifting global monetary policy.\n\nIf you decide to be part of that story, make sure your plan is built for **both** the 50k winter **and** the 300k summer.\n\n1.

According to their recent report on USDT, Tether’s reserves have shifted toward more volatile holdings over the past year. These perceived riskier assets, such as bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate bonds, now make up 24% of the reserve mix, up from 17% in 2024.\n\nOne of S&P’s sharpest criticisms in its downgrade of USDT lies in its growing reliance on bitcoin in particular as a reserve asset, now comprising 5.6% of the backing, which is well above the 3.9% reserve buffer Tether itself flagged in its latest quarterly report ([PDF]( According to S&P, this exposure amplifies risks tied to bitcoin’s notorious volatility.\n\nS&P also sees serious issues regarding transparency at Tether, as the stablecoin issuer’s attestations offer little more than high-level snapshots, with zero granularity on who holds these assets, how they’re custodied, or what counterparties lurk in the shadows.\n\nThat said, Tether’s reserves still lean heavily on short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, accounting for 75% of the reserves. Despite the alleged red flags from S&P, USDT has held its $1 peg through many of crypto’s wild rides over the years, notably handling billions in redemptions without a hitch during the [collapse of crypto exchange FTX](\n\nA Tether spokesperson told *Reuters* the company “strongly disagrees” with S&P’s assessment, which uses an outdated model that ignores USDT’s track record and role as vital infrastructure in emerging markets.\n\n[Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino went further on X]( framing the downgrade as a badge of honor: Tether “wears S&P’s loathing with pride,” thriving as an “overcapitalized” outsider to a flawed legacy system. “The classical rating models built for legacy financial institutions, historically led private and institutional investors to invest their wealth into companies that despite being attributed investment grade ratings collapsed,” Ardoino added.\n\n[In another post]( Ardoino pointed to Tether’s latest attestation [announcement]( where the company also claimed an excess reserve buffer approaching $30 billion; however, this is not explicitly part of USDT’s current reserves.\n\n# Trust S&P or Trust Bitcoin?\n\nIn another post, Ardoino referenced S&P’s failures during the 2008 financial crisis, which were portrayed by a blind woman in the associated film The Big Short. [S&P paid a $1.375 billion settlement]( in a related case with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding allegations that the ratings agency had defrauded investors with its ratings of financial products in the lead up to the housing crisis. Notably, Bitcoin itself was originally launched in January 2009, almost as a direct response to the collapse of trust involved in the financial crisis.\n\nJust weeks before scrutinizing Tether, [S&P also slapped a speculative ‘B-‘ issuer credit rating on bitcoin treasury company Strategy]( highlighting the firm’s $80 billion-plus bitcoin hoard as a vulnerability that could cripple debt payments amid market plunges. The agency’s outlook stays stable for now, but it flags Strategy’s negative cash flow and bitcoin concentration as red flags, much like the volatility risks baked into USDT’s reserves.\n\nWhile S&P sees issues with Tether and Strategy using bitcoin as a reserve asset, many other well-known institutions, such as [the Harvard University Endowment]( and [the state of Texas]( are buying the crypto asset to hold for the long term and find it to be useful as an apolitical, digital store of value.\n\nIt should also be noted that S&P is largely focused on stablecoin issuers’ ability to redeem tokens for dollars in their assessments, so an asset like USDT where the issuer is operating more like a bank issuing its own private currency doesn’t necessarily fit the mold perfectly. In other words, USDT may be viewed negatively by many in the traditional financial system because it is operating on a new standard built on bitcoin rather than the traditional, dollar-based system.\n\n[### U.S. Bank Calls Ability to Freeze Stablecoins ‘Appealing’ as Crypto Has Completely Lost the Plot\n\nThe endowment dramatically increased its holdings of a spot bitcoin ETF since its previous such report.](\",0.4\nbitcoin,SEC’s Hester Peirce Defends Self-Custody as Bitcoin Holders Shift to ETFs - Cointribune,https://www.cointribune.com/en/sec-leaders-back-crypto-self-custody-as-etf-adoption-reshapes-bitcoin-ownership/,\"19h30 ▪ 4 min read ▪ by James G.\n\nSelf-custody and financial privacy have returned to the forefront of the U.S. crypto conversation after SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce reaffirmed them as core individual rights. Her remarks come amid regulatory uncertainty, rising ETF adoption, and renewed debate over Bitcoin’s founding principles.\n\n* SEC officials call self-custody a fundamental right, while Congress delays the key crypto market structure bill to 2026.\n\n* Bitcoin holders shift to ETFs, driven by tax-friendly in-kind creations and simpler asset management choices.\n\n* Rising ETF adoption sparks debate as critics say moving away from self-custody weakens Bitcoin’s original purpose.\n\n* PlanB’s move to ETFs adds fuel to community concerns over growing reliance on third-party custodial services.\n\nPeirce, who also leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said on The Rollup podcast that holding one’s own assets should never be questioned in a nation built on personal freedom. According to her, [self-custody]( is a basic human right, and she expressed disbelief that Americans would be expected to rely on intermediaries to safeguard their assets.\n\nShe also stated that privacy should be standard in online financial activity rather than treated as a suspicious choice.\n\nHer comments come as the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act faces further delays. Senator Tim Scott confirmed that the bill, which addresses self-custody, AML rules, and asset taxonomy, has been pushed to 2026. Scott added that the broader effort aims to [empower everyday Americans]( in the growing digital economy. He also noted that lawmakers plan to present a bipartisan draft soon in hopes of delivering it to President Trump.\n\nDuring a June roundtable of the SEC Crypto Task Force, Commissioner Paul Atkins [voiced a similar position]( calling self-custody a core American value. His remarks reinforced Peirce’s stance at a time when industry behavior is shifting.\n\nRising interest in crypto investment vehicles is changing how long-term Bitcoin holders manage their coins. Many whales and early adopters are now moving assets into [exchange-traded funds]( motivated by tax advantages and simpler administration. Dr. Martin Hiesboeck of Uphold reported the first notable decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years.\n\n* Approval of in-kind ETF creations that avoid taxable events.\n\n* Preference for simpler asset management.\n\n* Growing comfort with regulated investment structures.\n\n* Reduced willingness to maintain private key security.\n\n* Influence of high-profile investors choosing ETFs.\n\nIn July, the SEC allowed in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs, enabling holders to exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares without triggering tax obligations tied to cash-settled products. Hiesboeck warned that this development moves the industry away from the long-standing “not your keys, not your coins” principle.\n\n[Sentiment in the Bitcoin community]( intensified after PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow model, revealed in February that he transferred his Bitcoin into ETFs to avoid the burden of managing private keys. His decision sparked strong reactions, with many arguing that surrendering custody contradicts Bitcoin’s purpose as a self-sovereign asset.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"\"Read to Earn\"\" program!

In the past five years, the leading cryptocurrency has soared 409% (as of Nov. 26).\n\nInvestors might be inclined to take a chance on Bitcoin on the recent dip. But where will this digital asset be in 2030?\n\nBitcoin has had a monster rise over the past decade. However, investors shouldn't extrapolate those gains going forward. The reasonable outlook is to expect lower returns, since the asset is maturing.\n\nThat being said, it wouldn't be surprising to see Bitcoin's price triple by the end of 2030. To do this, it would need togenerate a robust[compound annual rate of return]( of 25%. This would surely outperform the stock market by a wide margin.\n\nBitcoin's best trait is that it has a hard supply cap of 21 million units. This scarcity makes it a compelling asset to own, particularly as fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, constantly lose[purchasing power]( over time.\n\nThe current regulatory backdrop works to Bitcoin's benefit as well, making it easier for companies to build related products and services and for investors to access the crypto.\n\nBitcoin currently trades at around $88,000. In five years, it's not out of reach for it to trade around the $270,000 mark, if the bull run continues. As always, keep your risk tolerance in mind.\n\n*[Neil Patel]( has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin.

Instead, she said, privacy should be the default, not a sign of wrongdoing.\n\n“If you want to keep your transactions private, the assumption shouldn’t be that you’re doing something illegal,” she said. “It should be the opposite.”\n\nHer remarks arrive as uncertainty continues around US crypto legislation.\n\nAccording to Senator Tim Scott, the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act, a bill that addresses self-custody, anti-money laundering rules and the classification of digital assets, [has been delayed until 2026](\n\nThe lull has left the industry without a legal framework that directly addresses how Americans can legally hold and use digital assets.\n\nPeirce’s comments also come at a time when self-custody itself faces competition from Wall Street products.\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have made crypto easier to access for traditional investors, drawing some users away from holding coins directly in private wallets.\n\nDr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, said the industry is seeing the “first decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years,” as investors shift into ETFs for tax advantages and convenience.\n\nThe introduction of in-kind redemptions earlier this year allows ETF holders to swap crypto for shares without triggering a taxable event, a benefit that directly competes with personal wallets.\n\nThe debate intensified in February when analyst [PlanB disclosed that he had moved]( his Bitcoin into ETFs to avoid the stress of managing private keys.\n\nHe claimed that ETFs offer a convenient alternative, reducing the complexities and risks associated with holding private wallet keys.\n\nOne of the key reasons behind PlanB’s decision is the security challenge of managing private keys. “Not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind,” he stated.\n\nThe announcement sparked backlash from purists who see centralized custody as a betrayal of Bitcoin’s founding principles.\n\n* [[LIVE] Fed Payments Innovation Conference: Real-Time Updates as Federal Reserve Discusses Crypto, Stablecoins, and AI with Industry Leaders](\n\n* [XRP Price Prediction: UAE Just Approved Ripple’s Stablecoin – Can Arab Wealth Send XRP to $1,000?](\n\n* [XRP Price Prediction: ETF Inflows Aren’t Helping – Is Something Seriously Wrong With Ripple Right Now?](\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Turns Green Again – Is the Selling Finally Over?\n\nAt Cryptonews, we aim to make cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 understandable, and information available to everyone, no matter what level you are in your investment journey.

According to their recent report on USDT, Tether’s reserves have shifted toward more volatile holdings over the past year. These perceived riskier assets, such as bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate bonds, now make up 24% of the reserve mix, up from 17% in 2024.\n\nOne of S&P’s sharpest criticisms in its downgrade of USDT lies in its growing reliance on bitcoin in particular as a reserve asset, now comprising 5.6% of the backing, which is well above the 3.9% reserve buffer Tether itself flagged in its latest quarterly report ([PDF]( According to S&P, this exposure amplifies risks tied to bitcoin’s notorious volatility.\n\nS&P also sees serious issues regarding transparency at Tether, as the stablecoin issuer’s attestations offer little more than high-level snapshots, with zero granularity on who holds these assets, how they’re custodied, or what counterparties lurk in the shadows.\n\nThat said, Tether’s reserves still lean heavily on short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, accounting for 75% of the reserves. Despite the alleged red flags from S&P, USDT has held its $1 peg through many of crypto’s wild rides over the years, notably handling billions in redemptions without a hitch during the [collapse of crypto exchange FTX](\n\nA Tether spokesperson told *Reuters* the company “strongly disagrees” with S&P’s assessment, which uses an outdated model that ignores USDT’s track record and role as vital infrastructure in emerging markets.\n\n[Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino went further on X]( framing the downgrade as a badge of honor: Tether “wears S&P’s loathing with pride,” thriving as an “overcapitalized” outsider to a flawed legacy system. “The classical rating models built for legacy financial institutions, historically led private and institutional investors to invest their wealth into companies that despite being attributed investment grade ratings collapsed,” Ardoino added.\n\n[In another post]( Ardoino pointed to Tether’s latest attestation [announcement]( where the company also claimed an excess reserve buffer approaching $30 billion; however, this is not explicitly part of USDT’s current reserves.\n\n# Trust S&P or Trust Bitcoin?\n\nIn another post, Ardoino referenced S&P’s failures during the 2008 financial crisis, which were portrayed by a blind woman in the associated film The Big Short. [S&P paid a $1.375 billion settlement]( in a related case with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding allegations that the ratings agency had defrauded investors with its ratings of financial products in the lead up to the housing crisis. Notably, Bitcoin itself was originally launched in January 2009, almost as a direct response to the collapse of trust involved in the financial crisis.\n\nJust weeks before scrutinizing Tether, [S&P also slapped a speculative ‘B-‘ issuer credit rating on bitcoin treasury company Strategy]( highlighting the firm’s $80 billion-plus bitcoin hoard as a vulnerability that could cripple debt payments amid market plunges. The agency’s outlook stays stable for now, but it flags Strategy’s negative cash flow and bitcoin concentration as red flags, much like the volatility risks baked into USDT’s reserves.\n\nWhile S&P sees issues with Tether and Strategy using bitcoin as a reserve asset, many other well-known institutions, such as [the Harvard University Endowment]( and [the state of Texas]( are buying the crypto asset to hold for the long term and find it to be useful as an apolitical, digital store of value.\n\nIt should also be noted that S&P is largely focused on stablecoin issuers’ ability to redeem tokens for dollars in their assessments, so an asset like USDT where the issuer is operating more like a bank issuing its own private currency doesn’t necessarily fit the mold perfectly. In other words, USDT may be viewed negatively by many in the traditional financial system because it is operating on a new standard built on bitcoin rather than the traditional, dollar-based system.\n\n[### U.S. Bank Calls Ability to Freeze Stablecoins ‘Appealing’ as Crypto Has Completely Lost the Plot\n\nThe endowment dramatically increased its holdings of a spot bitcoin ETF since its previous such report.](\",0.4\nbitcoin,\"Bitcoin Plunges to Below $88,000 in Risk-Off Start to December - Bloomberg.com\",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-01/bitcoin-btc-slides-to-below-88-000-in-risk-off-start-to-december,\"[Confidential tip?\n\nCryptocurrencies fell sharply on Monday, bringing fresh momentum to a wide-ranging selloff that appeared to have settled.\n\nBitcoin slid as much as 4.3% to below $88,000 in early Asia trading, while Ether dropped 6% to below $2,900, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n[Bitcoin’s Drawdown Breaks Old Rule as Volatility Stays Tame]( Tops $90,000 as Options Point Toward Shifting Sentiment]( Pomp SPAC Deals Are Put to the Test by Crypto Crash]( Kwon Says Five Years in Prison Enough for Terra Crypto Fraud]( Exchange Upbit Hit by Exploit After $10 Billion Deal](\",0.4\nbitcoin,SEC’s Hester Peirce Defends Self-Custody as Bitcoin Holders Shift to ETFs - Cointribune,https://www.cointribune.com/en/sec-leaders-back-crypto-self-custody-as-etf-adoption-reshapes-bitcoin-ownership/,\"19h30 ▪ 4 min read ▪ by James G.\n\nSelf-custody and financial privacy have returned to the forefront of the U.S. crypto conversation after SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce reaffirmed them as core individual rights. Her remarks come amid regulatory uncertainty, rising ETF adoption, and renewed debate over Bitcoin’s founding principles.\n\n* SEC officials call self-custody a fundamental right, while Congress delays the key crypto market structure bill to 2026.\n\n* Bitcoin holders shift to ETFs, driven by tax-friendly in-kind creations and simpler asset management choices.\n\n* Rising ETF adoption sparks debate as critics say moving away from self-custody weakens Bitcoin’s original purpose.\n\n* PlanB’s move to ETFs adds fuel to community concerns over growing reliance on third-party custodial services.\n\nPeirce, who also leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said on The Rollup podcast that holding one’s own assets should never be questioned in a nation built on personal freedom. According to her, [self-custody]( is a basic human right, and she expressed disbelief that Americans would be expected to rely on intermediaries to safeguard their assets.\n\nShe also stated that privacy should be standard in online financial activity rather than treated as a suspicious choice.\n\nHer comments come as the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act faces further delays. Senator Tim Scott confirmed that the bill, which addresses self-custody, AML rules, and asset taxonomy, has been pushed to 2026. Scott added that the broader effort aims to [empower everyday Americans]( in the growing digital economy. He also noted that lawmakers plan to present a bipartisan draft soon in hopes of delivering it to President Trump.\n\nDuring a June roundtable of the SEC Crypto Task Force, Commissioner Paul Atkins [voiced a similar position]( calling self-custody a core American value. His remarks reinforced Peirce’s stance at a time when industry behavior is shifting.\n\nRising interest in crypto investment vehicles is changing how long-term Bitcoin holders manage their coins. Many whales and early adopters are now moving assets into [exchange-traded funds]( motivated by tax advantages and simpler administration. Dr. Martin Hiesboeck of Uphold reported the first notable decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years.\n\n* Approval of in-kind ETF creations that avoid taxable events.\n\n* Preference for simpler asset management.\n\n* Growing comfort with regulated investment structures.\n\n* Reduced willingness to maintain private key security.\n\n* Influence of high-profile investors choosing ETFs.\n\nIn July, the SEC allowed in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs, enabling holders to exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares without triggering tax obligations tied to cash-settled products. Hiesboeck warned that this development moves the industry away from the long-standing “not your keys, not your coins” principle.\n\n[Sentiment in the Bitcoin community]( intensified after PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow model, revealed in February that he transferred his Bitcoin into ETFs to avoid the burden of managing private keys. His decision sparked strong reactions, with many arguing that surrendering custody contradicts Bitcoin’s purpose as a self-sovereign asset.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"\"Read to Earn\"\" program!

In the past five years, the leading cryptocurrency has soared 409% (as of Nov. 26).\n\nInvestors might be inclined to take a chance on Bitcoin on the recent dip. But where will this digital asset be in 2030?\n\nBitcoin has had a monster rise over the past decade. However, investors shouldn't extrapolate those gains going forward. The reasonable outlook is to expect lower returns, since the asset is maturing.\n\nThat being said, it wouldn't be surprising to see Bitcoin's price triple by the end of 2030. To do this, it would need togenerate a robust[compound annual rate of return]( of 25%. This would surely outperform the stock market by a wide margin.\n\nBitcoin's best trait is that it has a hard supply cap of 21 million units. This scarcity makes it a compelling asset to own, particularly as fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, constantly lose[purchasing power]( over time.\n\nThe current regulatory backdrop works to Bitcoin's benefit as well, making it easier for companies to build related products and services and for investors to access the crypto.\n\nBitcoin currently trades at around $88,000. In five years, it's not out of reach for it to trade around the $270,000 mark, if the bull run continues.

After hitting a record above **$126,000 in early October 2025**, BTC slid sharply in November, briefly dropping near **$80,000** before stabilising. [[1]](\n\nBy 30 November 2025, Bitcoin is trading just above **$91,000**, according to multiple market data providers and price analyses. [[2]](\n\nAgainst that volatile backdrop, **Bitcoin price forecasts for 2026 are wildly split**. Serious models and analysts are now calling for anything from **$50,000** at the low end to **$300,000+** — with some aggregated forecasts stretching as high as **$500,000**.\n\nThis article pulls together the latest **2026 Bitcoin price predictions**, the macro and policy drivers behind them, and a few grounded scenarios to help you interpret the noise. It’s **informational only**, not financial advice.\n\nBefore digging into forecasts, it helps to understand the setup.\n\n* **New all‑time high, then a harsh reset.** Research from YouHodler and other analysts places Bitcoin’s all‑time high around **$126,000–$126,200 in early October 2025**. [[3]](\n\n* **A 30%+ November drawdown.** The Economic Times reports that BTC dropped roughly **31% in November**, falling from the October peak toward **$82,000** amid hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric, rising yields and nearly **$2 billion in crypto liquidations**. [[4]](\n\n* **ETF-driven but choppy demand.** BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has exploded to about **$70+ billion in assets**, helping push total BlackRock Bitcoin ETF allocations near **$100 billion** and making them the firm’s biggest revenue driver — but November also saw more than **$2.3 billion** in outflows as prices fell. [[5]](\n\n* **Policy tailwinds in the US.** The Trump administration has leaned into Bitcoin: Standard Chartered notes that BTC first broke **$100,000** after his election, and the bank now projects aggressive upside as regulatory and accounting rules become friendlier. [[6]](\n\nAt the same time, **macro uncertainty is high**. In November, DL News highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs just had their worst month for outflows since February, while analysts fret about liquidity, AI-bubble risks in equities and a divided Federal Reserve. [[7]](\n\nIn short: Bitcoin enters the 2026 window **battle‑tested**, heavily owned by institutions and governments, but sensitive to interest rates, liquidity and risk appetite.\n\nTraditional finance has finally embraced making explicit multi‑year Bitcoin calls — and they don’t agree with each other at all.\n\n* **Pro‑crypto US policy** under President Trump, including a federal working group on digital assets and discussion of a national digital asset stockpile. [[9]](\n\n* **ETFs unleashing pent‑up institutional demand**, with tens of billions flowing into spot products. [[10]](\n\n* **Falling volatility**, making BTC more acceptable as an institutional portfolio allocation alongside gold.\n\n### Bernstein / MarketWatch: Up to ~$200,000 on an “extended cycle”\n\n* The **current bull run, which began in 2023, could stretch through 2026 and peak in 2027**.\n\n* Bitcoin could climb toward **$200,000 within about a year**, helped by US pro‑crypto policies (including a proposed federal Bitcoin reserve) and sustained ETF adoption. [[11]](\n\nThis view effectively argues that the classic four‑year Bitcoin cycle may **“break” or lengthen** as policy and institutional flows matter more than simple halving math.\n\nOn the other side, Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist **Mike McGlone** has become a high‑profile bear:\n\n* He argues Bitcoin could **drop around 40%** from autumn levels and trade near **$50,000 in 2026** — roughly 60% below its $126k high. [[12]](\n\n* In a widely cited LinkedIn post, he framed the dilemma as **“Bitcoin $50,000 or $150,000 in 2026?”** and said his **bias is toward $50,000**, especially if the S&P 500 suffers a rare third down year in this cycle. [[13]](\n\n* **Gold outperforming** while crude oil and stocks wobble encourages investors to de‑risk away from volatile assets like BTC. [[14]](\n\n* **ETF outflows and liquidity stress** could deepen, mirroring the 2018 post‑bubble crash.\n\nJPMorgan hasn’t published a headline‑grabbing 2026 BTC price target, but its mining sector research gives clues:\n\n* The bank recently **upgraded selected miners** such as Cipher Mining and CleanSpark, lifting their **December 2026**price targets on expectations that high‑performance computing and AI workloads will support miner economics even if BTC prices stay under pressure. [[15]](\n\n* The Economic Times highlights their modelling as consistent with a **crypto “rebound” into 2026**, even after November’s sharp pullback. [[16]](\n\nThe takeaway: **Big banks are split** between extremely bullish trajectories (200k–300k) and more cautious or even bearish paths (~50k). None of them treat current levels near 90k as a comfortable equilibrium.\n\nCrypto‑native platforms and research shops tend to produce **structured, year‑by‑year tables**. While they’re not independent investment advice, they help map out the current sentiment.\n\n+ **2026 range: $100,000–$189,900** (updated November 2025).\n\n+ They describe this as a “conservative” range and see a broader long‑term path toward **$300,000 by 2030** if adoption continues. [[17]](\n\n+ FAQ section suggests Bitcoin could reach about **$173,672 by end‑2026**, assuming constructive long‑term trends. [[19]](\n\n+ Based on inputs from Binance users, the 2026 BTC value is projected around **$96,290.96** — essentially a modest gain from today. [[20]](\n\n+ Under a simple model assuming BTC appreciates **5% per year**, Kraken’s calculator produces a **2026 price of about $95,939.55** and around **$189,953 by 2040**. [[21]](\n\n+ Kraken explicitly notes this isn’t a forecast but a math exercise based on user‑chosen growth rates.\n\n+ A late‑September analysis collated public forecasts and found **2026 price targets ranging roughly from $60,000 to $500,000**, with a **median near $201,000** when outliers are included.

The article reports that published projections span from roughly **$99,000 on the low end** (InvestingHaven’s minimum) to about **$228,000** (an optimistic model dubbed Orange Standard), with several mid‑range forecasts around **$120,000–$165,000**. [[23]](\n\n> **Most crypto‑oriented forecasts cluster around a six‑figure BTC price in 2026**, typically between **$100,000 and $200,000**, assuming the current cycle doesn’t completely break down.\n\nAt the same time, tools from Binance and Kraken show that **small changes in assumed growth rates** dramatically shift these numbers — a reminder that many “forecasts” are really **parameter‑driven scenarios**, not crystal balls.\n\nNumbers aside, 2026 Bitcoin forecasts hinge on a few powerful themes.\n\n* BlackRock’s **IBIT** and its Brazil‑listed cousin have reached **around $100 billion in combined allocations** and now generate more revenue for the firm than long‑standing legacy ETFs. [[24]](\n\n* IBIT alone holds roughly **3.9% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply**, according to ZyCrypto’s reporting, underscoring how much of BTC’s float is now locked inside regulated vehicles. [[25]](\n\n* Continued **net inflows** into spot ETFs.\n\n* More jurisdictions (and potentially new products like leveraged, options‑based or yield ETFs) widening access.\n\n* Liquidity draining from risk assets if central banks stay tighter for longer.\n\n### 4.2 Halving cycles vs. “breaking the cycle”\n\nBitcoin’s **fourth halving** in 2024 cut new supply again, and historically, BTC has peaked **12–18 months after** a halving. Classic cycle models would therefore expect a major top sometime in **late 2025 or early 2026**.\n\n* Bernstein’s research (via MarketWatch) suggests the current bull run could **extend into 2026 and even 2027**, driven by policy and ETF demand, not just halving math. [[27]](\n\n* A Forbes contributor (in a paywalled piece) framed **2026 as a year of “breaking cycles”**, arguing that Bitcoin and stablecoins are increasingly tied to institutional behaviour, cross‑border payments and state‑level adoption rather than retail mania alone. [[28]](\n\nIf they’re right, **2026 could be more like the middle of a super‑cycle** than the tail end of the usual four‑year pattern.\n\n* Standard Chartered ties its aggressive BTC projections directly to **Trump‑era pro‑crypto moves**, including looser accounting rules and a friendlier regulatory framework. [[29]](\n\n* A separate DL News report describes the **“Bitcoin for America Act”**, a bill from Representative Warren Davidson that would allow Americans to **pay federal income taxes in Bitcoin**, with the proceeds flowing into a **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** now estimated around **$16 billion**. [[30]](\n\n> The idea that **nation‑states will compete to accumulate Bitcoin** is moving from Twitter meme to serious policy discussion — and that’s explicitly built into some of the higher 2026 forecasts.\n\nEven the best Bitcoin models crumble if the macro backdrop swings hard. Analysts watching 2026 point to several key variables:\n\n+ DL News notes that some Russian market experts see **no full Bitcoin recovery before spring 2026** if the Fed doesn’t ease policy. [[31]](\n\n+ Futures markets currently price a high probability of cuts in 2026 — but policymakers are openly divided on timing and magnitude. [[32]](\n\n+ CryptoNews reports on concerns from **Robert Kiyosaki** and others about a “global liquidity reset” driven by Japan’s changing fiscal stance and the unwinding of leveraged yen carry trades, which could temporarily hurt risk assets including BTC. [[33]](\n\n+ DL News links recent crypto drawdowns to equity volatility as investors question whether massive AI capex will pay off, pulling capital from high‑beta assets like Bitcoin. [[34]](\n\n* **2020–2021:** Aggressive easing, booming liquidity and tech optimism → most 200k–300k Bitcoin scenarios look more plausible.\n\n* **2018 or 2022:** Sticky inflation, balance‑sheet tightening and risk‑off sentiment → the more pessimistic 50k–80k paths come into play.\n\nForecasts are really just **different assumptions about that macro dice roll**.\n\nPulling all this together, you can group the current 2026 Bitcoin forecasts into three broad bands. These are not my predictions, just a way to organise what the market is saying.\n\n* Warnings about **ETF outflows**, liquidity drains and AI‑bubble fallout from multiple market commentators. [[36]](\n\n* **No sustained Fed easing**; rates stay high or cut only modestly.\n\n* ETFs flip from net buyers to **persistent net sellers**.\n\n* Bitcoin behaves more like a **high‑beta tech stock**, underperforming gold and sovereign bonds.\n\n* The 2024–26 cycle rhymes with **2017–2018**, with a long, grinding comedown from the 2025 peak.\n\nIn this scenario, Bitcoin is still far above its 2022 lows, but many of the six‑figure forecasts prove **too optimistic, too soon**.\n\n* Nasdaq / GOBankingRates’ summary of models between roughly **$99k and $228k**, with several mid‑range projections. [[40]](\n\n* **Macro softens gradually**: rates drift lower, but no huge money‑printing spree.\n\n* Spot ETFs keep a **net‑positive but choppy** flow profile, with periods of outflows offset by renewed interest. [[41]](\n\n* Bitcoin carves out a broad **six‑figure trading range**, with periodic spikes above 150k and sharp pullbacks, but no structural breakdown below prior cycle highs for long.\n\n* The 2024 halving still matters, but the peak doesn’t arrive in a clean 12–18 month window — price action is choppier and more drawn‑out.\n\nFor long‑term holders, this scenario still represents **solid real returns**, but the path is noisy enough that **leverage and over‑sizing can be dangerous**.\n\n* Bernstein’s extended‑cycle view, with a potential move toward **$200,000** as ETFs and a federal Bitcoin reserve reshape demand. [[43]](\n\n* YouHodler and other bullish long‑term models that see **$170k+** in the second half of the decade, with upside to **$250k–$700k by 2030** in optimistic scenarios. [[44]](\n\n* CryptoSlate’s compilation of public forecasts that stretches the **2026 high‑end up to about $500,000** in extreme cases. [[45]](\n\n* **Aggressive global ETF and institutional adoption**; pension funds, insurers and sovereign wealth funds make Bitcoin a standard allocation. [[46]](\n\n* The **US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** concept gains traction; paying taxes in BTC and similar policies encourage governments to accumulate rather than sell. [[47]](\n\n* Gold stagnates or loses mindshare as “digital gold” becomes a mainstream thesis.\n\n* Halving plus policy plus macro relief create **compounding tailwinds**, driving a parabolic leg that pushes BTC well beyond 150k – potentially into the Standard Chartered 300k zone.\n\nThis outcome is **not impossible** — but it requires **multiple favourable forces to line up at once**, with surprisingly few policy or macro shocks along the way.\n\nIf you’re reading Bitcoin price predictions for 2026, you’re probably thinking about **positioning**. A few practical ways to treat these forecasts as tools, not gospel:\n\nNotice how serious forecasters mostly give **bands** (e.g. $100k–$190k), not precise ticks. Treat any 2026 number as a **zone of possibility**, not a promise.\n\nA model saying “BTC could be 150k in 2026” doesn’t tell you whether it visits **50k first**. Many 2026 outlooks, including Kiyosaki’s and McGlone’s, explicitly warn about **sharp interim drawdowns** even in bullish long‑term scenarios. [[48]](\n\nThe biggest disagreements in 2026 forecasts aren’t really about Bitcoin’s code or halving schedule — they’re about **interest rates, liquidity and regulation**. Make sure your own plan makes sense in **both** a dovish and a hawkish world.\n\nSome of the highest numbers come from venues that also promote presales, meme coins or high‑yield products in the same breath. Use those forecasts as **sentiment signals**, not as investment blueprints. [[49]](\n\nIf you’re a short‑term trader, the difference between 120k and 200k in 2026 matters far less than **next month’s volatility**. If you’re a long‑term allocator, you may care more about whether Bitcoin credibly reaches **multi‑hundred‑thousand levels by 2030** than whether it finishes 2026 at 110k or 150k. [[50]](\n\nAll of the forecasts above — from banks, crypto platforms, AI models and columnists — can be wrong. Bitcoin remains **highly volatile and speculative**. You should only invest money you can afford to lose and consider getting advice from a qualified financial professional before making major decisions.\n\n## 8. Bottom Line: What Does a “Realistic” Bitcoin 2026 Forecast Look Like?\n\n* **Floor risk:** Serious analysts see a non‑trivial chance that Bitcoin could revisit **$50,000–$80,000** in a harsh risk‑off environment. [[51]](\n\n* **Central tendency:** Many structured models and consensus tools cluster around a **six‑figure BTC in 2026**, often in the **$100k–$150k** neighbourhood. [[52]](\n\n* **Upside tail:** A smaller but vocal group of banks and analysts think policy, ETFs and state‑level accumulation could push Bitcoin toward **$200k–$300k** by 2026, with extreme outliers talking about **half a million**. [[53]](\n\nNo one *knows* which path will win. What we can say is that **2026 is shaping up to be one of the most consequential years in Bitcoin’s short history** — a year where halving‑cycle tradition collides with ETF‑driven institutionalisation and rapidly shifting global monetary policy.\n\nIf you decide to be part of that story, make sure your plan is built for **both** the 50k winter **and** the 300k summer.\n\n1.

Instead, she said, privacy should be the default, not a sign of wrongdoing.\n\n“If you want to keep your transactions private, the assumption shouldn’t be that you’re doing something illegal,” she said. “It should be the opposite.”\n\nHer remarks arrive as uncertainty continues around US crypto legislation.\n\nAccording to Senator Tim Scott, the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act, a bill that addresses self-custody, anti-money laundering rules and the classification of digital assets, [has been delayed until 2026](\n\nThe lull has left the industry without a legal framework that directly addresses how Americans can legally hold and use digital assets.\n\nPeirce’s comments also come at a time when self-custody itself faces competition from Wall Street products.\n\nSpot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have made crypto easier to access for traditional investors, drawing some users away from holding coins directly in private wallets.\n\nDr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, said the industry is seeing the “first decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years,” as investors shift into ETFs for tax advantages and convenience.\n\nThe introduction of in-kind redemptions earlier this year allows ETF holders to swap crypto for shares without triggering a taxable event, a benefit that directly competes with personal wallets.\n\nThe debate intensified in February when analyst [PlanB disclosed that he had moved]( his Bitcoin into ETFs to avoid the stress of managing private keys.\n\nHe claimed that ETFs offer a convenient alternative, reducing the complexities and risks associated with holding private wallet keys.\n\nOne of the key reasons behind PlanB’s decision is the security challenge of managing private keys. “Not having to hassle with keys gives me peace of mind,” he stated.\n\nThe announcement sparked backlash from purists who see centralized custody as a betrayal of Bitcoin’s founding principles.\n\n* [[LIVE] Fed Payments Innovation Conference: Real-Time Updates as Federal Reserve Discusses Crypto, Stablecoins, and AI with Industry Leaders](\n\n* [XRP Price Prediction: UAE Just Approved Ripple’s Stablecoin – Can Arab Wealth Send XRP to $1,000?](\n\n* [XRP Price Prediction: ETF Inflows Aren’t Helping – Is Something Seriously Wrong With Ripple Right Now?](\n\nBitcoin Price Prediction: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Bet Turns Green Again – Is the Selling Finally Over?\n\nAt Cryptonews, we aim to make cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 understandable, and information available to everyone, no matter what level you are in your investment journey.
