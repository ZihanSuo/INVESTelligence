(NASDAQ:[**RIOT**]( is one of the [**best upside stocks to buy now**]( On November 24, JPMorgan lowered the firm’s price target on Riot Platforms to $17 from $19 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares. This price cut sentiment was posted as JPMorgan cited lower bitcoin prices and a higher share count.\n\nEarlier in its Q3 2025 financial results, Riot Platforms reported a total revenue of $180.2 million, which was an 18% increase from the previous quarter. However, net income for Q3 decreased substantially to $104.5 million from $219.5 million in the prior quarter.\n\nAdditionally, the company’s Bitcoin production slightly declined quarter-over-quarter. This was due to an 8% growth in the global hash rate, which outpaced Riot’s own 3% growth in hash rate deployment. The company faces a constrained power environment, which could potentially impact future expansion and development timelines.\n\nRiot Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) operates as a Bitcoin mining company in the US. The company operates in two segments: Bitcoin Mining and Engineering.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RIOT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.
