After being left for dead in the AI race, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has doubled in 2025 as investors warm to a sweeping turnaround plan, a 9.9% U.S. government equity stake, and fresh partnerships with Nvidia, SoftBank – and potentially even Apple. [[1]](\n\nWith the share price recently around **$40.56** after a Black Friday surge of more than 10%, the obvious question for investors is: **where could Intel’s stock be trading by 2026?** [[2]](\n\nThis article pulls together the latest **news, analyst targets and algorithmic forecasts** to outline a grounded, data-backed **Intel stock price forecast for 2026** – and the key risks that could make or break that outlook.\n\n> **Important:** This is **not** investment advice. It’s informational and educational only. Always do your own research or consult a licensed financial adviser before investing.\n\n* **Price & performance:** Intel trades near **$40–41**, up roughly **100% year-to-date**, and close to new 52‑week highs (approx. $17.67–$42.48 range). [[3]](\n\n* **Q3 2025 results:** Revenue in Q3 2025 was **$13.7 billion**, up 3% year‑over‑year. GAAP EPS swung from a **loss of $3.88** a year ago to **profit of $0.90**, while non‑GAAP EPS hit $0.23, with a sharp recovery in gross margins. [[4]](\n\n* **Business mix:** Client computing (PC chips) grew 5% YoY to $8.5B, while Data Center & AI slipped 1% to $4.1B. Intel Foundry reported $4.2B in revenue and remains loss‑making but strategically crucial. [[5]](\n\nThese improving fundamentals, combined with highly visible political and strategic backing, set the stage for **2026 to be a “proof year”** for Intel’s turnaround – especially its foundry ambitions and AI roadmap.\n\nIn **August 2025**, Intel and the Trump administration agreed to convert CHIPS Act grants into an equity investment:\n\n* The U.S. government is investing **$8.9 billion** into Intel common stock as part of a broader **$11.1 billion** support package. [[6]](\n\n* The stake is about **9.9–10% of Intel’s shares**, structured as a passive ownership with no board representation. [[7]](\n\n* **Upside:** De facto government backstop for foundry investments and fabs, which could reduce bankruptcy or capital‑access risk and support a premium valuation if the strategy works. [[8]](\n\n* **Downside:** Political scrutiny over layoffs, offshoring and buybacks, plus the possibility of policy‑driven rather than purely profit‑driven decisions. Critics already argue the deal is a heavy-handed intervention in corporate governance. [[9]](\n\nBy 2026, markets will have a much clearer view of whether this “national champion” status is a valuation tailwind or a drag.\n\n* **Nvidia** agreed to invest **$5 billion in Intel stock** and co‑develop multiple generations of custom data‑center and PC CPUs with Nvidia’s NVLink and GPU technology integrated. [[10]](\n\n* **SoftBank Group** committed **$2 billion** for Intel shares at **$23 per share**, becoming one of Intel’s larger shareholders. [[11]](\n\nTogether with the U.S. stake, that’s roughly **$15+ billion in new equity capital** anchored by major strategic and financial players.\n\n* Signal that **AI hyperscalers and capital allocators believe Intel’s 18A and future nodes can be competitive**.\n\n* Bolster the balance sheet and reduce funding risk for Intel’s massive fab build‑out in Arizona, Ohio and elsewhere. [[12]](\n\n* Lay the groundwork for **multi‑year revenue ramps** in AI infrastructure, potentially becoming visible in earnings models by 2026.\n\nThe single biggest catalyst behind Intel’s recent Black Friday surge was a familiar name: **Apple**.\n\n* Supply‑chain analyst **Ming‑Chi Kuo** said the odds of Apple using Intel as an **advanced‑node supplier for M‑series chips** have “improved significantly”, with shipments possibly starting in **2027**. [[13]](\n\n* Kuo reports that Apple has a **non‑disclosure agreement** and is waiting on Intel’s **18A PDK 1.0/1.1**, expected in early 2026 – a key milestone in proving Intel’s process readiness. [[14]](\n\n* Intel stock jumped **over 10%** on the rumor, becoming the best‑performing stock in the S&P 500 on Black Friday. [[15]](\n\nIf Intel delivers stable 18A silicon and Apple signs on in 2026 for 2027 production, the market could start **pricing in multi‑billion‑dollar foundry revenues** long before chips ship. That’s a key part of bullish 2026 price targets.\n\nA widely circulated TradingNews analysis highlights comments by Elon Musk that Tesla “might do something with Intel,” fuelling speculation that Intel could produce future AI5 chips for robotaxis and robotics. [[16]](\n\nWhile no formal deal has been announced, the **Tesla rumor reinforces a broader narrative**: if Intel can win *any* large AI chip customers besides Nvidia and potential Apple work, its foundry could move toward break‑even **around late 2026**, a milestone several bullish models are baking in. [[17]](\n\nThe other big storyline heading into 2026 is **intensifying competition with TSMC** and the legal risk around talent moves.\n\n* TSMC has sued former senior executive **Wei‑Jen Lo**, who joined Intel in 2025, alleging breach of contract and potential leakage of trade secrets. Prosecutors in Taiwan have raided his homes and seized devices as part of a probe. [[18]](\n\n* Intel strongly denies any wrongdoing and stresses that it prohibits the transfer of confidential third‑party IP, backing Lo in internal memos. [[19]](\n\nThis case underscores the stakes: with Intel now backed by the U.S. government and vying to repatriate leading‑edge manufacturing, **any misstep on IP or export controls could trigger sanctions, fines or reputational damage**, affecting valuations in 2026.\n\n* **TradingView** aggregates a **12‑month consensus target around $38.30**, with a high of $52 and a low of $24. [[20]](\n\n* **Benzinga** reports a lower consensus target of **$31.20** from 32 analysts, again with a wide range from **$20 (bearish)** to **$52 (bullish)**. [[21]](\n\n* **MarketBeat** data cited in a recent feature notes an average target of about **$34.84**, with the Street‑high target at **$52**, well below the post‑rally spot price near $40–41. [[22]](\n\n* **Most analysts still model Intel in the mid‑30s**, implying *downside* from current levels.\n\n* A **smaller group of bulls** sees upside toward the low‑50s – roughly **25–30% above** recent prices – based on a successful turnaround and higher AI/foundry contribution by 2026. [[23]](\n\nSince these are **12‑month** targets set in late 2025, they effectively cover an investment horizon stretching well into **late 2026**, making them a good benchmark for “base‑case” expectations.\n\nBeyond human analysts, several services publish **model‑driven Intel price predictions** that explicitly extend into 2026. They often disagree sharply – a useful reminder of how uncertain the path is.\n\n* That implies only around **+4–5%** upside from the current ~$40.56 base, but allows for sizable swings. [[24]](\n\nThis sits broadly in line with **cautious Wall Street targets** and assumes a slow, steady re‑rating.\n\nCrypto‑style data platform **CoinCodex**, which also models stocks, paints a more pessimistic picture:\n\n* It expects Intel to **fall to about $23.61 in one year**, a drop of roughly 40% from current prices.\n\n* Its long‑term model indicates the **highest expected price by 2026 is around $45.34**, suggesting limited upside beyond the mid‑40s. [[25]](\n\nCoinCodex’s technical dashboard currently labels sentiment as **“bullish”** in the short term, but its longer‑term algorithm still flags Intel as “not a good stock to buy” based on projected declines. [[26]](\n\nAt the other extreme, **LongForecast** – which uses a proprietary quantitative model – projects Intel could trade in the **$70–$90+ range during parts of 2026**, with December 2026 levels around the low **$90s**. That would more than **double the current price**, but with large month‑to‑month volatility. [[27]](\n\nThese numbers are **far above most analyst targets**, and should be treated as a highly speculative scenario rather than consensus.\n\nA detailed 2025 analysis from TradingNews lays out one of the more concrete 2026 valuation frameworks:\n\n* It highlights Intel’s **doubling in 2025 to around $44**, Nvidia’s $5B stake, the U.S. government’s $8.9B investment, SoftBank’s $2B, and potential Tesla and Apple chip work. [[28]](\n\n* The authors argue this capital and partnership stack, combined with cost cuts and EPS recovery, justify a **12‑month target of $55–$60**.\n\nThis is a **clearly bullish scenario**, but it aligns with the idea that if Intel executes well, 2026 could see **a structural re‑rating** rather than just cyclical improvement.\n\nRegardless of which numerical forecast you prefer, **most models key off a similar set of fundamentals**. Here are the levers that will matter most to Intel’s stock price in 2026:\n\n* Intel’s Q3 2025 results emphasize the ramp of its **18A process** (and future 14A) across both CPUs and foundry customers, with Fab 52 in Arizona now fully operational. [[30]](\n\n* Apple’s and other potential customers’ decisions in **2026** will hinge on the maturity and power/performance of these nodes. Delays or yield issues could quickly undercut bullish forecasts.\n\n* Intel Foundry generated **$4.2 billion in revenue** last quarter but remains heavily loss‑making. [[31]](\n\n* Bearish or cautious models assume the foundry continues to **bleed billions**, forcing Intel either to absorb ongoing losses or restructure again.\n\n* The AI server market is enormous and still growing fast; Nvidia and Intel frame their collaboration as targeting a **$150 billion‑plus market**, with x86 CPUs playing a major role. [[32]](\n\n* The extent to which Intel captures this demand – vs. remaining a secondary supplier – will heavily influence **earnings power by 2026**.\n\n* Intel’s Client Computing Group is already growing again (+5% YoY in Q3), benefiting from AI PC refresh cycles and new **Panther Lake** architecture on 18A. [[33]](\n\n* If AI PCs become a real secular upgrade cycle through 2026, they can provide **steady, high‑margin cash flow** that supports foundry investments.\n\n* The combined **government, Nvidia and SoftBank equity stakes** bolster Intel’s capital position but also **increase share count** and entangle the company in political priorities. [[34]](\n\n* How markets feel about this by 2026 – as a safety net or as “government overhang” – will influence the valuation multiple.\n\nGiven the wide dispersion of forecasts, it helps to think in scenarios rather than single‑point predictions.\n\n* 18A proves competitive; early 14A roadmap looks credible.\n\n* Nvidia collaboration ramps; Intel lands at least one significant **additional AI or automotive customer** (e.g., Tesla or another hyperscaler). [[35]](\n\n* Foundry losses shrink sharply, and investors believe in a path to **$10–12B foundry revenue by 2027**. [[37]](\n\n* The market to award a more typical **15–18x earnings multiple** (ex‑foundry adjustments), which underpins the **$65–$70** type 2026 targets seen in bullish research. [[39]](\n\n* The turnaround continues, but more slowly than bulls hope.\n\n* AI and PC trends are positive, but Intel remains a **challenger** rather than a clear share‑gainer.\n\n* The foundry moves toward smaller losses, but break‑even slips beyond 2026.\n\n* **Low‑40s:** consistent with StockScan’s average 2026 forecast (~$42) and some conservative analyst targets. [[40]](\n\n* **High‑40s to low‑50s:** If sentiment stays constructive and 18A progress is visible, Intel could trade closer to the top end of consensus price‑target ranges (~$50–52). [[41]](\n\n* Yield or delay problems at 18A/14A cause **customer hesitation or cancellations**.\n\n* Macro or AI spending slows, hurting data‑center demand and making the foundry economics even worse.\n\nThis is closer to **CoinCodex’s one‑year forecast** of ~$23.61 and its view that Intel’s stock could struggle to hold current levels by late 2026. [[43]](\n\n1. **Execution risk:** Intel’s recent history is full of missed timelines. Any further slip in 18A or 14A would directly undermine the foundry strategy, analyst confidence and multiples. [[44]](\n\n2. **Geopolitical risk:** Intel sits at the heart of U.S.–China tech tensions and domestic industrial policy. Export controls, sanctions or policy shifts could affect both demand and cost structures. [[45]](\n\n3. **Legal/IP risk:** The TSMC lawsuit around Wei‑Jen Lo highlights how aggressively rivals will defend IP – and how sensitive regulators are to trade secrets in the chip sector. [[46]](\n\n4. **Government overhang:** With the U.S. government holding nearly 10% of Intel, future debates over layoffs, labor conditions, or offshoring could lead to **political interventions that markets dislike**. [[47]](\n\n5. **AI cycle normalization:** If AI infrastructure spending normalizes faster than expected, or if competitors like TSMC, Samsung, AMD or ARM‑based players erode Intel’s share more than models assume, 2026 revenue and margins could disappoint.\n\n+ The stock has already doubled in 2025 and now trades above many published 12‑month price targets. [[48]](\n\n+ Traditional analysts cluster around **mid‑30s to low‑40s** a year out, modestly below or just above current levels. [[49]](\n\n+ See Intel as a **leveraged AI and reshoring play**, where successful execution on 18A and foundry economics could justify **$65–$70** and beyond by 2026. [[50]](\n\n+ Highlight ongoing execution and dilution risk, with some algorithms projecting the stock back toward the **mid‑20s** or worse if the turnaround disappoints. [[51]](\n\n* The **2026 outcome band is unusually wide**, spanning from deep downside to substantial upside, and depends heavily on technical milestones and political decisions.\n\n* Position sizing, diversification, and time horizon are crucial: Intel may fit best as one piece of a broader **semiconductor or AI basket** rather than a single‑name bet – especially if your thesis is focused on 2026.\n\nAgain, this article is **not investment advice**. But if you’re watching Intel into 2026, the **numbers to watch** will be:\n\nThose will likely move the stock far more than any single algorithmic price prediction.\n\n1. [ 2. [ 3. [ 4. [ 5. [ 6.
