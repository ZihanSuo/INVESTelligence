Residents have been trying to [incorporate their neighborhood]( to gain legal authority to impose local noise restrictions after years of [frustration over the nonstop hum]( of industrial cooling fans.\n\n[According]( to The Texas Tribune, thousands of fans work around the clock to cool down nearly 60,000 computers in the facility.\n\nThis petition is just one example of [towns]( [state officials]( [private groups]( and [youth groups]( taking action and [holding corporations accountable](\n\nA MARA spokesperson wrote to [KERA]( that the company took legal action in response to the residents' push to form their own city, which \"serves no lawful or legal purpose.\"\n\n|  | | --- | | FROM OUR PARTNER Kick-start the holiday season with an extra $1,500 off a premium e-bike Unlock your next great adventure with a [high-tech e-bike]( at an unbeatable price.
