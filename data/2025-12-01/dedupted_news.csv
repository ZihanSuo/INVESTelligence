rare earth,The Rare Earth Metal Driving Tensions Between the US and China - WIRED,https://www.wired.com/story/yttrium-rare-earth-metal-china-us/,"Yttrium plays a critical role in everything from aircraft engines to semiconductors. China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing anytime soon.

The alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have [promised a truce over rare earth minerals]( the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow.

Although a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the [Chinese export restrictions]( introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains.

But other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down.

Yttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in plasma etching. Its indispensable nature has made it a key element of modern technology and the military.

The problem is that, as with several other resources, China controls almost the entire global yttrium supply chain. Not only does it produce most of it, but it also has the know-how and infrastructure to refine and separate it from other rare earth minerals, a complex and technologically advanced process. According to US data, the United States imports 100 percent of its yttrium needs, 93 percent of which comes directly from China. Such stark dependence creates enormous geopolitical vulnerability.

When Beijing decided to introduce export restrictions as a response to US tariffs, the entire international supply structure began to falter. Companies reported delays, difficulties in obtaining licenses, and uncertainty about delivery times. In the rare earths trade, lack of predictability is often more damaging than reduced volumes: An industry accustomed to just-in-time deliveries can be thrown into crisis by even a few weeks of delay.

The effects were immediate. In Europe, yttrium oxide prices have soared, reaching a 4,400 percent increase since the beginning of the year. Aerospace companies, which rely heavily on this material, have expressed alarm and demanded urgent measures from the US government to expand domestic production. The semiconductor industry is no less concerned: Some companies have called the situation a “serious” threat, predicting impacts on costs, efficiency, and production timelines. Gas-fired power plants, which use yttrium in the protective coatings of turbines, are also monitoring Chinese developments with increasing attention, although they maintain that they have not yet experienced disruptions.

The situation in warehouses outside China adds further layers of complexity. Available reserves, according to piecemeal estimates, range from one to 12 months, depending on the producers. Some traders have already reported running out of material; from quantities in the hundreds of tons range, many are down to just a few units. Others are completely out of stock. This volatility makes the market extremely fragile and underscores how the global supply chain depends on a small number of players.

Chinese exports to several countries have fallen by about 30 percent. China, which aims to become an autonomous tech powerhouse, therefore maintains a position of strength and a high degree of discretion, carefully regulating the quantities released to the international market. Moreover, the measures introduced by Beijing in the sector from the outset are flexible enough to allow it to modulate the flow of shipments according to political priorities.

On the political front, the trade truce between Washington and Beijing has yet to produce concrete results. The two sides have given negotiators until the end of November to outline clearer terms for rare earth exports to the United States, but the gap between their respective priorities remains wide. Beijing continues to work on a licensing system, inspired by mechanisms already used by the United States, that would allow for faster flow only to companies deemed to have no ties to the US military industry. This would leave many Western companies operating in the delicate boundary between civilian production and defense applications at a disadvantage, further complicating access to materials.

China's strategy involves not only controlling trade flows, but also managing technical expertise internationally. Authorities have begun requiring detailed lists of technicians specializing in rare earths, restricting their travel abroad and monitoring potential transfers of expertise to rival countries. At the same time, bans on the export of advanced rare earth processing technologies continue, a sector in which China holds a leadership position that is unlikely to be replicated in the short term. This dual approach—control of physical resources and human capital—strengthens Chinese primacy and hampers attempts to build an alternative supply chain.

The United States is nevertheless trying to fight back. New industrial projects, such as that of ReElement Technologies in Indiana, aim to produce yttrium oxide domestically starting in December, with an initial capacity of 200 tons per year, set to double within a few months. While this figure isn't enough to cover total US needs, it represents a first step toward diversification.

During Trump's recent visit to Asia, Japan and the United States signed an agreement to jointly exploit the giant Minamitori undersea deposit, discovered years ago in the Pacific seabed. Washington and Tokyo announced the launch of a joint study to develop technologies and infrastructure capable of extracting these strategic materials from extreme ocean depths, a feat that will require enormous investment and advanced technical cooperation.

Yet the absence of a complete supply chain—from extraction to refining—makes the transition slow and complex. China has no intention of giving up its dominant position, a crucial and potentially decisive negotiating lever.

rare earth,"Australian miners thrust into spotlight as yttrium rockets 4,000% - Mining.com.au",https://mining.com.au/australian-miners-thrust-into-spotlight-as-yttrium-rockets-4000/,"There’s a village on the Swedish island of [Resarö]( in the Stockholm archipelago with residential streets named after chemical elements, such as Ytterbium Road, Terbium Road, and Tantalum Road.

The streets may seem quiet and unassuming yet this village, called Ytterby, is one of the most important places in scientific history – it’s regarded as the single richest source of elemental discoveries in the world. [Yttrium]( (Y), [terbium]( (Tb), [erbium]( (Er), and [ytterbium]( (Yb) are all named after the village.

Other elements including holmium, gadolinium, scandium, tantalum, and thulium were first discovered there, making Ytterby the richest source of naturally occurring elements on Earth.

Back in 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius discovered a strange, unusually heavy black ore in an old quarry near Ytterby. This new ore was named by Arrhenius as ytterbite.

Two years later, a Finnish chemist identified from Arrhenius’ initial sample the first rare earth element – named yttrium. In just over 50 years following Arrhenius’ original discovery, Carl Gustav Mosander found that ytterbite was actually a mixture of three metal oxides, and a fourth was later discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac from the original sample.

Eventually as refining techniques improved, more new elements were discovered and ultimately over the next 100 years since Arrhenius’ discovery, nine more elements fell out of this strange, unusually heavy black ore.

Among these hard-to-pronounce elements is yttrium – a soft, grey-white metal that is fairly stable in air but reacts with water, acids, and bases.

It occurs in other ‘rare earth’ minerals, monazite and bastnaesite, though xenotime, which is mined in China and Malaysia, can contain up to 50% yttrium phosphate, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Yttrium metal is produced by reducing yttrium fluoride with calcium metal and is often used as an additive in alloys for its strengthening properties. When alloyed with aluminum, magnesium, and chromium, it acts to strengthen those metals.

In addition to its applications in speciality alloys found in engines, yttrium is used in coatings to shield against high temperatures.

Yttrium oxide is added to glass used to produce camera lenses as it makes them heat and shock resistant. It’s found in white LED lights as well as superconductors and lasers, with yttrium oxysulfide widely sought to produce red phosphors for old-style colour television tubes.

Lasers that can cut through metals require yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG), marking yet another of its many applications in everyday life.

While its origins may come from Sweden, like other rare earths and critical minerals, China dominates global production and supply of yttrium. China supplies the US 93% of its yttrium imports, creating acute vulnerability across Western supply chains.

The world’s supplies are now running low due to Chinese export restrictions, sparking fears of looming protracted shortages, and rocketing costs that could hit every sector from aerospace, to energy and semiconductor production.

On the back of China restricting yttrium exports (along with six other rare earths in April in retaliation to the US tariffs) yttrium oxide (Y₂O₃) prices have been soaring more than 4,000% in Europe in 2025.

Recently, prices surpassed US$275/kg, as China’s tightening export controls disrupt global supply chains for military and defence, aerospace, semiconductors, and advanced materials. These shortages are also affecting markets related to high-temperature alloys, laser systems, avionics, and defence components.

Magnet rare earth prices also remain high, with Benchmark reporting Dy oxide (DDP China) at over US$200/kg and Tb oxide (DDP China) at almost US$1,000/kg.

[Victory Metals]( (ASX:VTM) CEO Brendan Clark says this global backdrop highlights the company’s strategic positioning as a major future yttrium supplier with what’s emerging as a valuable heavy rare earth basket.

The company’s current mineral resource hosts over 35 million kilograms of Y₂O₃ with forecast production targets over 600 tonnes annually tonnes along with strategic critical minerals dysprosium, terbium, neodymium and praseodymium, gallium, hafnium, and scandium.

Clark says yttrium is emerging as one of the world’s most important critical minerals and this global supply crunch is happening much faster than anyone expected.

*“Our North Stanmore deposit continues to demonstrate the scale, grade, and mineralogy required to supply Western nations with secure, long-term yttrium supply,”* the CEO adds.

Victory is now advancing discussions with multiple strategic partners across the defence, aerospace, automotive, and semiconductor sectors seeking secure non-Chinese heavy rare earth supply.

Clark says the surge in yttrium pricing materially enhances Victory’s Prefeasibility Study (PFS), with the company continuing to integrate high value heavy rare earths including yttrium, dysprosium, terbium, and recently confirmed gallium into its economic modelling.

The CEO recently told shareholders at the company’s AGM that China’s moves to ban the export of key defence-related minerals such as terbium, dysprosium and scandium is an opportunity for Victory Metals to demonstrate its capability to produce these critical materials at scale and to help Australia become a key player in the global energy transition.

*“We expect the PFS will define the processing pathway, costs, and production strategy for the North Stanmore project, and demonstrate how the underlying resources can be turned into a commercial, scalable operation,”* Clark says.

Clark notes an exhaustive PFS into Victory’s flagship North Stanmore Project, near Cue in Western Australia’s Mid West region, continues to indicate the project’s potential as one of the most advanced heavy rare earth clay-hosted deposits.

> ***“We are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements”***

*“Indications are we can avoid complex cracking or additional capital-intensive processing and environmental impacts, which further strengthens our value as a secure, reliable and capable potential supplier of high-purity feedstock to global processors,”* the CEO adds.

*“With minimal processing under our proposed operating model, we are confident we can deliver significant grade increases in terbium, dysprosium and scandium – three of the world’s most valuable and strategically critical elements.”*

Over the past 12 months, Clark says Victory has attracted strong international and institutional backing, and significant interest from government and private sector defence manufacturers around the world seeking secure off-take agreements.

In August 2025, the company raised $11.5 million through a placement of new shares to institutional, professional and sophisticated investors.

In October, Victory signed a non-binding LoI with Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corporation to advance offtake and strategic cooperation for North Stanmore, covering up to 30% of annual production, including up to 50 tonnes of Dy-Tb product over an initial five-year term.

The Export-Import Bank has also offered an LoI regarding funding support of US$190 million.

Victory Metals is among a number of Australian rare earths explorers thrust into the global spotlight, following the landmark agreement between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to facilitate the investment of the billions of dollars needed to establish secure and reliable rare earth and critical minerals supply chains.

With the state of the market, [ABx Group]( (ASX:ABX) has also been ramping up efforts to become a significant player in rare earths space. It’s been raising $6.05 million through a placement to fund development activities at the Deep Leads Project in Tasmania and construction of the ALCORE pilot plant.

Funds will be deployed to engineering and metallurgical studies, exploration drilling for a resource increase, and to secure offtake agreements for the Deep Leads Project.

Proceeds will also cover construction and commissioning costs of the ALCORE pilot plant to produce hydrogen and fluoride from aluminium smelter bath waste.

The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation ([ANSTO]( has started production of ABx’s first mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) product using 50kg of a 100kg bulk sample, with completion expected before the end of November 2025.

The sample will be distributed to potential customers and offtake partners for evaluation.

ABx is running a program to produce a saleable MREC product from its Deep Leads ionic adsorption clay rare earth project in Tasmania to be used in downstream refining to produce separated rare earth oxides, REE metals, and magnets essential for EV motors, guidance systems, wind turbines, and other clean-energy technologies.

Rare earth refineries (solvent-extraction plants) commonly accept MREC because it’s a standardised, transportable feedstock from which high-purity rare earth oxides and metals can be produced.

In partnership with external engineering experts, ABx conducted a formal processing options analysis. A key conclusion is that column leach tests should be conducted to confirm that the high extractions obtained in diagnostic leach tests in tanks are also observed in a column leach arrangement.

ANSTO is conducting initial column leach tests planned to begin in November, with results available by early 2026.

Managing Director of emerging rare earths producer [OD6 Metals]( (ASX:OD6), Brett Hazelden, believes there is plenty of opportunity for Western countries like Australia to capture a substantial share of the burgeoning market dominated by China.

Recently speaking to *Mining.com.au*, Hazelden says US President Donald Trump is changing the way governments work with private industry, which reshaping how government and private partnerships can work in an investor scheme to bolster Western supply chains.

If the Western world does not want all roads leading to China, Hazelden argues they need to obviously pay a fair price that allows people to make money but also allows them to participate in the next part of the value chain as well.

The make-up of OD6’s Splinter Rock Rare Earth Elements Project in Western Australia opens up a plethora of potential end-user avenues for the minnow. The emerging rare earths producer has proven it can produce a clean, high-quality mixed rare earth carbonate, which is a product highly sought after by several end users.

OD6 has now identified another avenue for consideration down the track for the production of samarium and yttrium oxides, which are both used in nuclear reactors for clean power generation and nuclear medicine.

Samarium is also used in the manufacture of high-temperature samarium-cobalt magnets for headphones, electric motors and aerospace applications.

In early October, OD6 elected a preferred [flowsheet]( with the aim of producing MREC and mixed rare earth hydroxide (MREH). Flowsheet testing undertaken by ANSTO achieved a MREC recovery of about 56% total rare earth oxide (TREO), and a MREH recovery of roughly 59% TREO.

The process demonstrated low levels of aluminium, iron, phosphorus and silicon impurities, and extremely low uranium and thorium content of less than 0.001%. Overall recoveries of the most in-demand magnet rare earths, neodymium and praseodymium, reached around 75% for OD6.

The high value magnet rare earths account for 23% of the TREO grade at Splinter Rock, which hosts a resource so far of 682 million tonnes @ 1,338 parts per million for 910,000 tonnes of contained TREO. The magnet rare earths provide about 205,000 tonnes of the contained resource.

rare earth,Victoria strengthens critical minerals capabilities with green light at Goschen - Australian Mining,https://www.australianmining.com.au/victoria-critical-minerals-green-light-goschen/,"Victoria is continuing to deliver accelerated critical minerals capabilities thanks to an approved mining work plan for VHM’s Goschen rare earths and minerals sands project in the state’s northwest.

The work plan covers pre-production logistical considerations such as how to protect the local environment and community, including requirements such as monitoring air quality data and publishing real-time dust level data online.

Located in Victoria’s premier mineral sands corridor, the project is underpinned by a [199 million tonne proved and probable ore reserve]( and is understood to be scalable with a 629 million tonne mineral resource with “ongoing growth potential”.

Victoria has been described as [possessing world-class mineral sand deposits]( containing demonstrated resources of titanium, zirconium and rare earth elements. As such, developing these is crucial to energy transition as it helps provide the materials needed for solar panels, wind turbines and batteries.

The project is understood to boast over 400,000 tonnes of total rare earth oxide alongside a “world-class” mineral sands resource, making it one of Australia’s most significant [critical minerals projects](

News of work plan approval comes after Victoria’s critical minerals future was advanced with the [approval of an exploration tunnel at the Sunday Creek]( antimony and gold projects, highlighting a shift in focus from both mining companies and industry bodies.

Described as one of Victoria’s “most significant mineral sands and rare earths projects”, Victorian Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio noted the move goes beyond simply critical mineral capabilities across Victoria.

“Critical minerals development in the Wimmera and Mallee could support up to 7,000 new jobs in the coming decades, and we are backing local communities with these well-paying jobs,” she said.

The [approval]( forms part of the Labor government’s Critical Minerals Roadmap set out last year to unlock the state’s critical minerals potential.",0.9,4
rare earth,2 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 5 Years - The Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/30/2-monster-stocks-to-hold-for-the-next-5-years/,"* Multibagger stocks can grow your wealth exponentially.

* Niche players in high-potential industries can deliver monster returns over time.

* Robotics and rare earths are two such industries you'd want to look at right away.

These two stocks could skyrocket as they exploit their first-mover advantages in two massive industries.

Some stocks don't just outperform the broader markets -- they have the potential to deliver monumental returns over time, supercharging your portfolio for years to come. They're not hard to find if you know where to look. Such stocks with [multibagger]( potential are often hidden among leaders in fast-growing industries, first movers in industries with exponential potential, and innovative start-ups that are shaping the future.

Two such stocks have caught my attention. Each has such compelling growth prospects that buying them now and holding them could yield monster returns over the next five years or so.

Rare-earth elements technically aren't rare, but it's not easy to extract them in ways that are economically viable. China has a monopoly, accounting for almost 70% of the global rare-earth extraction. That also means [80% of the rare-earth elements consumed in the U.S.]( are imported, with nearly all of them coming from China.

That's not a great place to be. Rare-earth elements are vital for electronics, semiconductors, robotics, [defense]( and aerospace technologies, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and more. However, China's dominance poses significant supply risks to the U.S. Additionally, it has always disincentivized U.S. [mining]( companies from pouring money into rare-earth elements. President Donald Trump wants to change that and, therefore, has allocated billions of dollars to critical mineral projects, even buying stakes in some domestic producers to secure U.S. supply chains.

There is only one active rare-earth mine in the U.S.: the Mountain Pass in California, owned and operated by **MP Materials** ([MP](/quote/nyse/mp/) +2.99%).

In July 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense, rebranded as the Department of War (DOW) by Trump, acquired a 15% stake in MP Materials and became its largest shareholder. MP Materials will build a rare-earth magnet manufacturing facility, known as the 10X facility, with the DOW committing to purchase 100% of the rare-earth magnets produced at the facility for 10 years. Two of its other major deals include:

* A $500 million multiyear agreement with tech giant **Apple** ([AAPL](/quote/nasdaq/aapl/) +0.46%) to supply magnets.

* A partnership with the DOW and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to develop a rare-earth refinery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

MP Materials currently produces rare-earth oxides and metals and will begin production of magnets by the end of 2025. [MP Materials stock already carries a market cap of $10 billion]( but that could look minuscule five years from now.

Shares of **Symbotic** ([SYM](/quote/nasdaq/sym/) 4.04%) have surged over 250% so far in 2025, as of this writing. And there could be a lot more to come.

Symbotic automates warehouses and distribution centers with [artificial intelligence (AI)]( [robotics]( that can move, store, and sort items. Symbotic went public in 2022 but has been working with **Walmart** ([WMT](/quote/nyse/wmt/) +1.31%) since 2015 to deploy robotic systems at multiple distribution centers. In January 2025, Symbotic acquired Walmart's advanced systems and robotics (ASR) business for automated fulfillment of orders, a new product category for Symbotic.

Under yet another new and recent agreement, Symbotic will develop and install automated micro-fulfillment systems for online pickup and delivery at Walmart's retail stores. Symbotic expects its first prototype to be ready in 2026. Meanwhile, Symbotic is developing a next-generation storage technology as well. Besides Walmart, Symbotic's other customers include **Albertsons**, C&S Wholesale Grocers, GreenBox, and **Target**.

Symbotic has also just announced something big: It has signed up Medline as a customer, marking its foray into healthcare. [Medline is a major distributor of medical supplies]( in the U.S. and is expected to go public soon. Symbotic deployed its first system to Medline last quarter.

Symbotic's entry into healthcare marks a significant milestone, as it opens up a new vertical for the company beyond retail and could fast-track its sales growth. Symbotic just posted a 26% growth in revenue for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 27, 2025, and projects similar growth for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.

Most importantly, Symbotic ended the year with a backlog of $22.5 billion. That's huge, as it represents nearly a decade's worth of sales. So, even though Symbotic's market cap has surpassed $50 billion, its estimated addressable market runs into the hundreds of billions of dollars, making it a solid stock to own for the long term.

Both MP Materials and Symbotic share a common link -- they have the first-mover advantage in their respective industries, *and* both industries have exponential growth potential. That's what makes these stocks so appealing. Growth stocks carry their share of risks, but with both Symbotic and MP Materials already generating revenue and striking significant partnerships, they're worth the risk.

The bigger news from **BPM** this week was that it [**raised $3.5M to help expand and accelerate drilling**](/quick-takes/bpm-raises-funds-drilling-on-wa-gold-asset-to-start-in-few-days/) at its WA gold project (*which should start in the coming weeks*).

**ILA** was [**added to the Medical Countermeasures Coalition**](/quick-takes/ila-added-to-a-coalition-of-companies-which-includes-multi-billion-dollar-big-pharma-companies/) (MC2) to advance US procurement and stockpiling opportunities.

*Some interesting names make up that coalition, including a few who have a proven track record developing drugs that went onto get big US stockpiling deals.*

**PNN** announced [**results from a drill program**](/quick-takes/pnn-now-weeks-away-from-10000m-drill-program-on-brazilian-rare-earths-asset/) on its Brazilian rare earth project.

*The results were from a shallow auger program, and delivered further high grade niobium and rare earths results...*

*Next PNN will kick off the first phase of a 10,000m RC drill program (due to start in December) ahead of a “maiden resource in Q1-2026”.*

**SGQ** hit [**extensions to its already large rare earths resource**](/quick-takes/sgq-hits-extensions-to-the-biggest-rare-earths-resources-deposit-in-south-america/) in Brazil.

*SGQ has 3 rigs drilling 24/7, 29 assays in the lab and 40 more holes planned... so we should see more good news like this week’s results over the coming weeks/months.*

**KAU** is looking at ways [**to get more feed**](/quick-takes/kau-to-drill-waste-dumps-next-to-victorian-processing-plant/) through its processing plant in Victoria...

*One of those had samples with grades of 0.86g/t, the other 1.8g/t... both very processable grades especially so close to KAU’s Victorian plant and an all time high gold price.*

**ION** raised $4.4M to “*Advance E-Waste Recycling Opportunities in the USA*”.

*We participated in ION’s capital raise - we especially liked that there was almost no discount to the market price AND the board participated in the round (both good signals for a capital raise).*

**LSR** started its [**first exploration program**](/quick-takes/lsr-starts-exploration-on-us-heavy-rare-earths-project/) on its project in Arizona.

*Previous sampling at LSR’s project showed 0.53-1.26% TREO, importantly with ~57% heavy rare earths (the valuable ones).*

*The big win for us will be if LSR can show those same grades are consistent across a bigger part of its project.*

**SS1** [**released another drill result**](/quick-takes/ss1-hits-silver-and-gold-26m-above-its-existing-480m-ounce-silver-equivalent-resource/) from its 2025 drill program.

*The kicker for us was that mineralisation in the assay results started a lot closer to surface compared to where SS1’s resource estimate begins.*

*Near surface results could be a game changer for SS1’s project, removing all of the risks related to pre-stripping a deep orebody (i.e. mining the waste rock above the existing resource).*

**HAR** [**completed its second round of drilling**](/quick-takes/har-completes-drilling-on-gold-project-assay-results-coming-next-month/) on its gold project in Senegal.

*HAR is following up the results from a few months ago including the 20m intercept grading 6.54g/t gold.*

*HAR is moving very quickly here (which always makes us pay a lot more attention) and has already committed to deeper RC/diamond drilling in early 2026.*

This week **HAR** also [**confirmed a drill rig is on site**](/quick-takes/har-to-start-drilling-on-us-gold-project-today/) at its US based gold project in California **AND that drilling was scheduled to have started on the night shift of Friday 28th November.**

The goal is to convert the current resource to JORC compliant, and HAR expects to complete this by late January 2026.

**TTM** [**released more drill results**](/quick-takes/ttm-results-set-to-add-to-resource-as-lingbao-prepares-for-another-visit/) from its 3.1Moz gold and 22Moz silver project in Ecuador.

*More interesting to us though was the confirmation, strategic investor Lingbao was “preparing a second site visit” as part of its due diligence toward doing a potential project level transaction with TTM for the Dynasty Gold Project.*

**88E** put out an [**update on its projects in Alaska**](/quick-takes/88e-to-flow-test-well-next-to-711m-neighbour/), USA.

*88E is fully carried for all costs associated with an upcoming horizontal well and extended flow test. 88E’s farm in partner is Burgundy Xploration, who is gearing up for an IPO in the US to support operational spend.*

**MNB** provided an [**update for its Cabinda phosphate project**](/quick-takes/mnb-update-on-angolan-phosphate-project/) in Angola.

*IF the alternative structure can be pulled off, MNB could be fast-tracking first production by simplifying its processing flowsheet, removing crushing, drying, and dust extraction to cut ~$20M in CAPEX and $17/t operating costs.*

*There is a fair bit to go through the announcement - Long story short, there looks to be a delay in the first production date mentioned months ago.*

**TG1** [**identified unmapped historical workings**](/quick-takes/tg1-finds-unmapped-historic-workings-on-recently-acquired-project/) at its Dalgaranga Gold Project in WA.

*TG1’s new project sits in a relatively well understood part of WA so it was a surprise to find unmapped historic workings. - a small open pit mined at 2.5g/t gold and multiple shallow workings.*

*Usually these historic workings are found on remote sites - so we liked that announcement from TG1.*

**L1M** [**raised $2.5M to fund drilling**](/quick-takes/l1m-raises-25m-exploration-programs-to-start-early-next-year/) on its QLD and NSW assets.

*We participated in the raise and we are looking forward to Phase 2 of L1M drilling its Queensland gold asset, following up the encouraging mineralisation it hit during Phase 1 drilling in recent months.*

**EIQ** has developed (and is already in the market with) an AI-powered algorithm that helps cardiologists detect heart diseases.

EIQ’s tech is already USA FDA approved AND being used by a growing number of hospitals in the USA to detect one heart disease called Aortic Stenosis.

**Earlier this week EIQ announced results of a clinical validation study on a different heart disease - Heart Failure.**

Heart Failure is one of the big heart diseases - US$60BN is spent on it, 1 in 4 Americans will get it, and it's the leading cause of rehospitalisation.

EIQ’s clinical validation study was run by the prestigious Mayo Clinic. The study delivered exceptional results on **detecting heart failure with 99.5% sensitivity and 91.0% specificity** ([source](

Much better than the only other AI heart failure detection software used in the market today which delivers **sensitivity of 87.8% and specificity of 81.9%** ([source](

(Both technologies are a step change from current practices where only 50% of Heart Failure cases are accurately diagnosed.)

IF EIQ can get FDA approval for its Heart Failure AI model, there already exists a reimbursement code the company can use to commercialise its AI tech.

The reimbursement code exists thanks to Ultromics (who [raised US$55M]( in a series C funding round valuing them at US$300M / A$464M back in July).

Now we watch for FDA clearance...

**IIQ** is developing an exosome platform technology.

IIQ is applying its exosome platform to develop diagnostics (detecting diseases) AND therapeutics (treating diseases).

Exosomes are tiny, microscopic extra-cellular “containers” that carry ‘messages’ between the human body's cells that allows the human body to function.

**IIQ is going after two types of cancer that have NO approved/recommended treatments or diagnostic tools.**

* Ovarian cancer is usually asymptomatic (no symptoms) in the early stages of the disease. If a woman is diagnosed at stage 1 - the survival rates can be over 90%. If a woman is diagnosed at stages 3/4 survival rates can be ~29%. ~70% of all ovarian cancer in Australia is diagnosed as advanced [stage 3 or 4 cancer](

* At the moment there are no recommended screening tests for women who show no symptoms of ovarian cancer - meaning there is no quick and easy screening test that can be regularly taken by all healthy women to catch ovarian cancer early.

* **IIQ’s screening test has been able to detect all stage 1 and 2 ovarian cancers (the earliest but asymptomatic stages where survival rates are the highest), with over 99.6% specificity (catching 99.6% of all patients with cancer) AND NO misdiagnosis.**

* **What’s Next:** IIQ to do a larger clinical validation study (to see if the test works on a larger cohort of patients) then look at “strategic partnering” to commercialise the screening tool.

* Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive type of breast cancer that does NOT respond to traditional breast cancer therapies.

* At the moment, there are no approved cell therapies treating triple negative breast cancer.

* IIQ is developing the therapeutic under a deal signed with the prestigious Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Peter Mac) in Melbourne. The institution is among only a handful globally that combines a dedicated cancer hospital with a fully integrated cancer research program.

* **So far IIQ has shown that its therapeutic was able to kill more than 90% of the cancer cells within 10 hours of treatment in in vitro studies (in a laboratory setting).**

* **What’s next:** Next for the therapeutic is the results from animal studies (in-vivo) due this quarter.

We think that any solid tumour therapeutic IIQ is able to develop could be a game changer for the company.

Mainly because it would de-risk IIQ’s platform tech (if it works for one cancer, why wouldn't it work for others?)...

We called **BKB** our 2025 Next Investors Small Cap Pick of the Year because it acquired 100% of a previously producing, high grade silver project, in Texas, USA.

While it sits in Texas USA, geologically, it actually sits on Mexico’s famous Sierra Madre belt, which is home to some of the world’s biggest silver producers.

**We want to see BKB get this project back into production as quickly as possible, while silver prices are at all time highs** (we think the silver price could go on a generational run over the coming years and have positioned our Portfolio for this scenario).

AND in the nearer term, we want to see the BKB team execute on their plan to restart their silver mine and processing plant in Texas while drilling out to grow their in ground silver resource.

This week BKB announced high grade rock chips OUTSIDE of the existing silver resource (grades up to 3,100 g/t silver):

Silver gapped up almost 10% this week so all eyes on the open for this one tomorrow.

**EXR** is the biggest net acreage holder in the Taroom Trough - second only to supermajor $320BN Shell.

EXR just did a deal with the #3 landholder in the region - Omega Oil and Gas.

Omega took a 19.43% position in EXR in exchange for $13.9M at 4.1c per share.

Omega is backed by Tri-Star (pioneers of the Queensland gas industry) and it recently did a deal with ~$2.8BN Beach Energy.

After all is said and done EXR will have a $35.3M capital budget to work with.

AND next, EXR is drilling a vertical well targeting a ~1 trillion cubic feet of contingent gas resource (estimate).

Drilling starts in January...

And then a horizontal section, with stimulating and testing will follow straight after.

It all kicks off on the 12th of January according to the EXR MD and CEO Stuart Nicholls in a webinar a few days ago. ([Source - watch it here](

We also noticed that were two specific conditions as part of Omega’s investment in EXR.

First the “standstill” - which means Omega can’t buy any more shares in EXR for at least 12 months - basically EXR is given a 12-month period to deliver material catalysts (like the Lorelle drilling and horizontal well)...

And second, the support condition - which basically means if EXR were to attract a takeover offer within the next 12 months from someone OTHER THAN Omega, Omega wouldn't be able to block the transaction (UNLESS they are willing to match/beat the proposal).

We think this is a very good deal for EXR shareholders, especially if the January drill results come in...

## A word of caution...

While we aim to highlight developments in the small cap space, investing in early-stage and small cap companies - like those we cover - is inherently risky.

These companies often face funding challenges, regulatory hurdles, and market volatility. Announcements may reflect aspirations more than guaranteed outcomes.

Things can, and often do, change.

Just because a company has signed a deal, released drill results, or appointed a new director doesn’t mean success is assured.

Always assume delays, cost overruns, or results that don’t pan out.

rare earth,How to watch asteroid Eros's close encounter with Andromeda galaxy - NewsBytes,https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/science/eros-to-pass-by-andromeda-tonight-how-to-watch/story,"LOADING...

[Home]( / [News]( / [Technology News]( / How to watch asteroid Eros's close encounter with Andromeda galaxy

Today, a rare celestial event will occur as the near-Earth asteroid (433) Eros passes close to the Andromeda Galaxy. The Virtual Telescope Project and Asteroid Foundation are hosting a livestream of this unique occurrence. The event will begin at 3:00pm EST (1:30am IST tomorrow) and feature expert commentary from Gianluca Masi, founder of the Virtual Telescope Project.

The close approach of asteroid Eros to the Andromeda Galaxy is a rare opportunity. ""Having such an important near-Earth asteroid just a couple of degrees away from the legendary Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) is a precious opportunity,"" Masi told *Space.com*. He added that this event offers a chance to appreciate the importance of these kind of minor planets and the beauty of our cosmic neighbor, the Messier 31 island-universe.

Eros, the first near-Earth asteroid discovered in 1898, was later visited by [NASA]( NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft. The probe orbited the 33km-wide body before making history with the first-ever asteroid landing on February 12, 2001. Now, Eros will be just 60 million kilometers away from Earth when it passes within two degrees of Andromeda's core tonight.

To catch a glimpse of the wandering asteroid, viewers should look for both Eros and Andromeda high above the eastern horizon in the hours after sunset. First locate the constellations Cassiopeia and Andromeda using a star-finding astronomy app. Then use these to find their way to Andromeda.",0.9,1
rare earth,Zijin founder who built the $100 billion Chinese miner retires - Mining.com,https://www.mining.com/web/zijin-founder-who-built-the-100-billion-chinese-miner-retires/,"[Bloomberg News](/external-author?author=Bloomberg News) | November 30, 2025 | 5:13 pm  [Careers]( [Top Companies]( [China]( [Copper]( [Gold]( [Lithium](

Zijin Mining Group Co.’s founder Chen Jinghe will step down as chairman after steering the company to the upper echelon of global metals miners following a decades-long run of growth.

The 68-year-old will become honorary chairman and senior consultant for the company after deciding to not accept nomination as a candidate for the board due to age and family reasons, according to an exchange filing on Saturday. The Fujian-based group didn’t name a successor.

Zijin’s market value ballooned to [more than $100 billion this year]( for the first time, underpinned by surging prices for its key commodities, especially copper and gold. The company started with a small gold mine in China in the 1980s, and its value is now only surpassed by Rio Tinto Group and BHP Group.

Zijin’s competitiveness is “systematic and structural” and the company’s “successful growth story will continue,” Citigroup Inc. analysts including Jack Shang wrote in a note. The bank maintained the miner as a top pick, saying that its copper and lithium assets are undervalued.

A company with enduring success should transit from being “founder-driven” to “institution-driven,” and the management team is mature, making it the best time to transition to a new leadership, Chen said in the statement.

Zijin shares rose as much as 6.9% in Hong Kong on Monday alongside other producers of copper after the metal advanced to a record.

rare earth,This Mining Stock Is Up 385% in 2025. 1 Reason This Could Be Just the Beginning. - AOL.com,https://www.aol.com/articles/mining-stock-385-2025-1-093500725.html,"# This Mining Stock Is Up 385% in 2025. 1 Reason This Could Be Just the Beginning.

* TNC The Metals Company is sitting on an extremely valuable reserve of polymetallic rocks.

* The only thing holding it back is obtaining a license to start extracting these rocks from the deep sea.

The world wants more data centers and electric cars. To build them, it needs materials like copper, nickel, cobalt, and manganese. Most of these metals come from mines that not only tear through forests and leave toxic tailings, but are also very expensive to build and maintain.

**TMC The Metals Company** (NASDAQ: TMC) is pitching a different way to obtain these [metals]( In simple terms, it wants to vacuum rocks that contain these metals (""nodules"") off the seafloor of the Pacific Ocean.

***Where to invest $1,000 right now?** Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the **10 best stocks** to buy right now. [**Continue »**](

Excitement about the potential for this company helped boost the stock as much as 854% in 2025; however, the [mining stock]( is down about 49% from all-time highs hit in mid-October. For long-term investors, the underlying idea behind this company could be reason enough to buy this dip.

Image source: The Metals Company.

The strongest argument supporting TMC's future growth is the combined net value of about $23.6 billion of the metals it expects to extract.

In August 2025, the company published two technical assessments that assigned that multibillion-dollar value to nodules in its exploratory area. Since the company is still only valued at about $2 billion, that project value gives its dreams some real economic backing.

On top of that, TMC ended its third quarter with about $115 million in cash, which should give a couple of years of runway with its current [cash burn rate](

The catch, of course, is that TMC does *not* have regulatory approval to mine the area under its exploratory control. Indeed, although it's been making progress on that front, the concrete steps needed to finally obtain that license are somewhat opaque at this moment.

If TMC can get through the regulatory process with a valid license to mine the seafloor for nodules, TMC's 385% gain so far in 2025 will be a prologue to something much bigger. Investors who are willing to make that bet could be rewarded, although be warned: This speculative stock will likely get bumpier until the road to mining is clear.

rare earth,High gold prices hit demand across major Asian hubs - Mining.com,https://www.mining.com/web/high-gold-prices-hit-demand-across-major-asian-hubs/,"[Reuters](/external-author?author=Reuters) | November 30, 2025 | 8:16 am  [Markets]( [Asia]( [China]( [Gold](

Gold demand was subdued across major Asian markets this week, as high prices curbed retail buying even as India entered its wedding season, while in China, the removal of a tax exemption on gold purchases dented consumer appetite.

This week, Indian dealers were offering a discount of up to $18 per ounce over official domestic prices – inclusive of 6% import and 3% sales levies – narrower than last week’s discount of up to $21.

Domestic gold prices were trading around 126,100 rupees per 10 grams on Friday, up 4.4% from last week’s low of 120,762 rupees.

“Buyers are uneasy with the current high prices, waiting for a correction, which has kept demand very weak,” said Ashok Jain, proprietor of Mumbai-based gold wholesaler Chenaji Narsinghji.

Jewellers are also holding off on building stocks [for the ongoing wedding season]( as footfalls at their stores have dropped sharply after surging during the Diwali festival, said a Mumbai-based bullion dealer with a private bank.

Weddings are a major driver of gold purchases in India, with jewellery a key part of bridal attire and a common gift from families and guests.

Spot gold prices climbed on Friday, poised for a fourth straight monthly rise, bolstered by bets on interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in December, while an outage at exchange operator CME Group halted futures trading.

In top consumer China, bullion traded anywhere from a premium of $1.40 to discounts of up to $16 an ounce compared with the global benchmark spot price.

“People are concerned about the tax (exemption) in China, so trading is still low,” said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals.

On November 1, Beijing [cut a value-added tax exemption]( for certain gold purchased through the Shanghai Gold Exchange and the Shanghai Futures Exchange, a move expected to push up costs for gold used in jewellery and industry.

In Singapore, gold was sold at par to a premium of $2.50 this week. Gold in Hong Kong traded at par to a premium of $1.80.

In Japan, bullion was sold at par with spot prices.

rare earth,Newmont Gold Surges: How the Market’s Golden Child Defies Volatility in 2025 - Ad-hoc-news.de,https://www.ad-hoc-news.de/boerse/news/ueberblick/newmont-gold-surges-how-the-market-s-golden-child-defies-volatility-in/68401283,"Sie befinden sind hier: [Startseite](/) > [Börse](/boerse/news) > [Ueberblick](/boerse/news/ueberblick) > Newmont Gold Surges: How the Market’s Golden Child ...

Newmont Gold has enjoyed a powerful rally these past three months. As investor focus tightens on rising gold prices and strategic moves, what’s next for the world’s preeminent goldmine giant?

Over the past three months, Newmont Gold has captured market attention with an impressive surge, posting a gain of nearly 22%. The stock journeyed from autumn uncertainty to trading firmly above $90 by late November, according to NYSE data (ISIN: US6516391066). For seasoned watchers, the momentum was palpable: metals hit new highs, and Newmont Gold rode that wave hard. But is this just a pause before another rally – or the sign of a cyclical peak?

News broke throughout November that pushed the entire precious metals sector higher. As of November 24, Newmont shares rallied sharply following a noticeable uptick in gold prices—part of a sector-wide breakout that saw mines and explorers alike flirt with new year-to-date highs. Not long before, Newmont Corporation had reported results that analysts dubbed 'solid, if not spectacular,' but it was the commodity’s price action that truly moved the needle. Roughly mid-November, gold breached technical resistances, and Newmont—always among the first to benefit—jumped. According to Marketscreener and Mining.com, this surge coincided with a spike in investor interest across top gold stocks.

November 21 brought an upward revision in target price from Argus Research, boosting confidence and fueling a multi-day rebound for Newmont shares. The same month, rallies in sector peers reinforced bullish sentiment, reflecting a broader appetite for gold exposure amid macroeconomic uncertainties and whispers of future Federal Reserve moves. However, the ride wasn’t without bumps: a negative market reaction followed the strong mid-November U.S. jobs report, temporarily pulling gold miners' shares down before the recovery swiftly set in again.

Broader headlines hint at deeper trends. In recent press briefings, Newmont Corporation spotlighted its expansion efforts: in late October, the company celebrated the start of commercial gold production at its Ghana Ahafo North mine—a new milestone amplifying the group's global production footprint. By mid-November, partner talks around Papua New Guinea hinted at further diversification. And on the corporate side, awards for HR practices suggest a strengthening of Newmont’s organizational backbone, an often-overlooked ingredient for stability in turbulent times.

What sets Newmont Gold apart? Established as one of the world’s leading gold mine operators, Newmont’s core business revolves around extracting gold (nearly 90% of 2023 sales), but copper, silver, zinc, and lead contribute significant revenue streams. The company operates 21 production sites, with key regions spanning North America, Australia, South America, Africa, and New Guinea. This global spread supports risk management and offers a unique hedge against regional volatility.

Financially, Newmont boasts a robust balance sheet: with an enterprise value approaching $98 billion and a modest leverage profile (net debt negative), the group stands out for its capital efficiency. 2025 estimates suggest a forward P/E ratio of just over 13, with an annual dividend yield at 1.1%—not overwhelming, but attractive to stability-minded shareholders. And with nearly 100% free float, the stock is as liquid as gold gets.

Strategically, Newmont is in expansion mode. The Ghana milestone signals intent to build beyond legacy holdings, while ongoing copper discussions in Papua New Guinea open doors to further mineral diversification. The company’s past year saw conscious steps towards growth, operational discipline, and ESG leadership. Still, as with all gold giants, Newmont must navigate commodity price volatility, geopolitical risks in mining regions, and the ever-present scrutiny of environmental and governance practices. The guidance updates and investor dialogue fit a pattern of cautious optimism—growth, yes, but not at any cost.

So, what lies ahead? Newmont Gold stands at a crossroads of opportunity and challenge. The strong Q4 performance (next earnings date slated for February 18) and positive analyst revisions highlight upside potential, especially if the gold price super-cycle persists. Yet, investors should watch for swings driven by macro events, dollar fluctuations, and sector competition. Either way, Newmont’s proven resilience, diversified mine portfolio, and appetite for strategic moves ensure it remains a stock to follow closely in the precious metals narrative.

rare earth,One discovery that Oriented 2025: 12 Days of Christmas - Mining.com.au,https://mining.com.au/one-discovery-that-shaped-2025-12-days-of-christmas/,"As the mining and resources industry winds down for the year and the festive season settles in, [*Mining.com.au*]( is unwrapping a 12-day macro series, exploring the forces shaping the sector.

Much like the classic carol, each day builds on the last. On the first day we’re diving into one gift that set the tone of the year for critical minerals explorer [Iltani Resources]( (ASX:ILT).

Since June 2023, the company has focused exploration efforts at the Orient deposit near Herberton in Far North Queensland, uncovering its prospectivity to produce silver, lead, zinc, and indium.

Earlier this year, Iltani’s efforts paid off when the company flagged the asset to potentially be one of the *“highest-grade known silver-indium”* deposits, emerging as one of 2025’s brightest lights in critical minerals exploration, as [reported]( by *Mining.com.au*.

The project comprises two main areas of focus – Orient East and Orient West – within the greater Herberton Project, which spans around 367km2 in the Herberton Mineral Field.

The combined deposits have returned a maiden resource estimate of 62.5 million tonnes @ 81.5 grams per tonne silver-equivalent at a 30g/t cut-off grade, with a higher grade core of 34.2 million tonnes @ 110.4g/t silver-equivalent with a 60g/t cut-off grade – the kind worth placing under any explorer’s Christmas tree.

Orient East hosts a resource of 19.8 million tonnes @ 98g/t silver-equivalent, with a higher grade core of 12.6 million tonnes @ 128g/t silver-equivalent, as [reported](

On the return of recent versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) target drilling at the project, Iltani says Orient has demonstrated potential to materially increase the mineral resource.

*Mining.com.au* [reports]( across a 10-hole shallow campaign, the first hole (ORR128) delivered multiple intersections of *“thick”* silver-lead-zinc-indium mineralisation, 450m north of the Orient East resource zone.

Mineralisation remains open along strike and down-dip, which is believed to upgrade the resource substantially.

Iltani has received its final assay results from VTEM drilling, such as 20m @ 93.8 grams per tonne silver-equivalent (AgEq) from 4m, including 6m @ 132g/t AgEq from 18m; 3m @ 130.9g/t AgEq from 170m, including 1m @ 279.3g/t AgEq from 171m.

The company is now conducting a surface electromagnetic (EM) survey at the Orient to target deeper anomalies generated by VTEM drilling, as [reported](

Speaking to *Mining.com.au* on the sidelines of the [Noosa Mining Investor Conference]( Iltani Managing Director Donald Garner says the main revenue drivers for the project are silver, then followed by zinc, lead, and indium in that order.

*“As long as gold sees high, silver will see high,”* Garner tells this news service.

As the festive season approaches, silver has been enjoying its own holiday cheer, marked at US$49.99 per ounce as of 24 November 2025, indicating a 73.12% for the commodity’s value from this year to date [according]( to Trading Economics.

Zinc on the other hand is priced at US$3,010, almost at a 1% increase for this year-to-date.

*“Zinc recently almost touched a dollar fifty a pound, which is really good to see. The Zinc TCs treatment charges are low, which is also good,”* Garner adds.

*“If we are successful with the permitting and development process, we’ll be in production in three or four years’ time.”*

At the same conference, Garner describes sentiment to be high ahead of the year’s end for miners across different commodities.

*“There’s a resurgence in commodity prices, gold sales in particular, but the base metals are doing well and you’ve got this increasing interest in critical minerals,”* Garner mentions.

*“They want to see mining in the state. They want to see value created in the state, jobs, revenues – it’s a really good time to be working in Queensland.”*

Iltani is [receiving]( an $8 million investment from the Queensland Investment Corporation’s (QIC) Critical Minerals and Battery Technology Fund (QCMBTF) to further develop the Orient Project.

The total grant comprises $6 million in cash in exchange for a 2% royalty on future product sales from the greater Herberton Project if commercial production begins by the end of 2030, otherwise boosting to 2.5%, as well as $2 million cash for the issue of 5.41 million shares.

Shares will be issued at $0.37 each, indicating a 10% discount to the 20-day volume weighted average price prior to the agreement.

*“Now with the funding from the QIC, we’ll build on what we’ve got and do more,”* Garner adds.

The QIC is a state government-owned corporation that manages the QCMBTF to bolster businesses focused on supporting Queensland’s critical minerals supply chain, holding $131.6 billion worth of assets under management as of 30 June 2025.

Garner explains that while the Iltani’s main priority is exploring the Orient Project, the company is always looking for opportunities to *“create value for shareholders”.*

*“If we don’t look, we won’t find and you’ll never know when we’ll come across one of those,”* Garner says.

*“We’re growing the team at Orient to make sure we deliver the best possible project for our shareholders and for Queensland.”*

The company will focus on drill targets inside the Caldera Complex including the Boonmoo gold and Union Jack base metal targets, before mapping the Orient and Antimony Reward projects.

*“Once we understand the controls of the mineralisation, we might go back to Antimony Reward but our main focus is at Orient,”* Garner tells [*Mining.com.au*](

The Antimony Reward deposit sits roughly 17km from Orient, also within the Herberton Project in Queensland.

Iltani completed initial drilling at the asset in 2024, with assays [returning]( 7m @ 7.61% antimony from 38m, including 3m @ 8.19% from 38m and 1m @ 26.70% from 43m in hole ARRC001.

Hole ARRC003 intersected 3m @ 0.75% antimony from 31m, including 1m @ 1.25% from 32m; and 4m @ 0.43%, including 1m @ 1.28% from 42m, while hole ARRC004 intersected 9m @ 0.94% from 53m, including 2m @ 2.66% from 60m.

Iltani Resources is a mineral explorer focused on the discovery and development of critical minerals for a clean energy future.

As day one of *Mining.com.au*’s 12 days of Christmas series comes to a close, Iltani’s discovery highs in 2025 sets the tone for the next year and the next door on our advent calendar.

rare earth,Exploration funding reaches ‘turning point’ in Australia: report - Australian Mining,https://www.australianmining.com.au/exploration-funding-reaches-turning-point-in-australia-report/,"A new report suggests an “aggressive rush of capital” has hit Australia’s exploration sector as governments and investors move to strengthen and diversify critical mineral supply chains.

The *September quarterly cash update* report, released by professional services company BDO, shows $3.49 billion flowing into the sector as a result of investors and governments moving “more decisively” to [reinforce long-term critical minerals supply capabilities](

“Australia’s traditional September fundraising slump did not materialise, with the quarter instead breaking a decade-long pattern of weakness,” the report said.

The report marks the first time in four years that explorers have experienced consecutive quarterly [increases in funding]( – going against a “usual downturn” of cash inflow.

The quarter delivered an 81 per cent rise in funding from June, driven by 78 companies raising more than $10 million each and capturing $2.88 billion of the total inflow.

These positive numbers have been described as a turning point for exploration in Australia, with the race for strategic resources accelerating at a pace the market has not seen in years.

“The scale of these raisings tells you exactly where global priorities are shifting,” BDO global natural resources and energy leader Sherif Andrawes said.

“Investors are backing assets that matter to energy security, electrification and industrial capability.”

Both copper and gold performed strongly in the quarter, the report stated, with [gold remaining the largest contributor]( – 21 explorers are said to have raised over $500 million on the back of record gold prices and increased global demand.

[Copper-linked companies]( are also said to have performed strongly, reflecting the metal’s central role in electrification.

Exploration spending climbed to $843.66 million, a 16 per cent rise driven by gold and copper explorers. Cash balances rose to an average of $11.02 million, the first lift in a year.",0.9,0
rare earth,Neuron Energy raises ₹31 crore to scale up EV-battery production in India - Telematics Wire,https://telematicswire.net/neuron-energy-raises-%E2%82%B931-crore-to-scale-up-ev-battery-production-in-india/,"India’s EV battery startup [Neuron Energy]( has secured ₹31 crore in a Pre-Series B funding round — a move many see as a big vote of confidence in domestic battery manufacturing.

The funds, led by Equanimity Ventures along with investments from the Rajiv Dadlani Group, Thackersay Family Office, Chona Family Office and other high-net-worth investors, will enable Neuron to boost its manufacturing capacity to **3 GWh annually**. The plan includes building a fully automated, state-of-the-art battery facility for electric four-wheelers and buses at Chakan, Pune — signalling the company’s ambitions beyond two-wheelers.

Beyond scaling production, the capital infusion will fuel R&D, support expansion into heavier EV segments, and help Neuron Eye a global footprint. According to Neuron, the low-CapEx and low-OpEx model it follows has helped it maintain profitability year-on-year; with this round, total funding now reaches ₹80 crore.

As India’s EV market accelerates and demand for dependable battery supply surges, this development could mark a key inflection point — giving India a stronger shot at building a home-grown, scaled-up battery-manufacturing backbone for both domestic and export markets.

rare earth,How Beca is redefining tailings for modern mining demands - Australian Mining,https://www.australianmining.com.au/how-beca-is-redefining-tailings-for-modern-mining-demands/,"As mineral operations target higher recovery rates from increasingly lower-grade and complex orebodies, mineral processing circuits are producing finer ore feeds to enhance mineral liberation.

This shift is resulting in a growing proportion of ultra-fine tailings – particularly those under 45 micrometre (µm) – which present significant challenges in handling, consolidation, and rehabilitation.

Due to their narrow particle size distribution and lack of larger particles, these tailings exhibit poor packing densities. This limits their ability to develop sufficient material strength, reducing opportunities for reuse and leading to continued reliance on traditional tailings storage facilities, in-pit disposal or low-strength underground backfill.

While dry stacking is gaining traction, its widespread adoption is constrained by cost, climate conditions (especially in tropical and wet environments), and the technical demands of dewatering large volumes.

As tailing volumes grow and environmental expectations rise, mining operations face increasing pressure to manage waste more responsibly. Several critical risks must be addressed to help ensure safe, sustainable and cost-effective tailings handling, storage and repurposing:

Escalating liabilities – large tailings storage facilities pose significant long-term risks, including community safety concerns, environmental degradation, and rising life-of-mine costs.

Limited repurposing potential – reusing tailings at scale is often constrained by factors such as distance from viable markets, difficulty in achieving sufficient material strength due to fine particle sizes, and the need to stabilise leachable constituents.

Brine management challenges – tailings and brine disposal are closely linked, particularly during mine closure. Effective management requires an integrated strategy that begins early in the mine’s life and continues through closure and monitoring.

Modern mining operations are being met with rising expectations to reduce the environmental and community impacts of tailings. Key priorities include minimising surface tailings storage, improving long-term stability, and expanding opportunities for repurposing.

Beca brings leading expertise across the full tailings lifecycle, from identifying suitable geological and geotechnical conditions for storage facilities to mine closure and post-closure monitoring. The team designs optimal slurry characteristics tailored to the intended storage method, whether traditional slurry, paste, or filter cakes. It also develops backfill formulations, manages tailings dams and leads innovative repurposing strategies.

“What sets Beca apart is our pioneering work in tailings reuse,” Beca chief metallurgist Paul Language said. “We focus on enhancing mineral recovery and enabling the beneficial reuse of tailings both on-site and off-site, contributing to more sustainable and economically viable mining operations.”

The long-term stability of any tailings storage facility depends on selecting landforms with robust geotechnical characteristics. Given the extended operational life of these facilities, confidence in early-stage data is critical.

Beca offers deep expertise through a team of more than 160 geotechnical engineers, engineering geologists, and hydrogeologists across Australia, Southeast Asia and New Zealand.

“We deliver comprehensive studies to identify and assess suitable landforms for safe, sustainable tailings storage,” Beca minerals and metals segment director Tristan Musgrave said.

Slurry thickening and handling are central to effective tailings management, whether for traditional storage low-strength backfill or dewatering. With over 40 years of scientific and engineering experience, Beca understands the importance of slurry rheology in transport and dewatering systems.

“Our approach includes fundamental slurry testing to inform pump system design and dewatering  to ensure project success,” Language said. “We design systems that accommodate variability in tailings feed, optimise water recovery, and reduce energy consumption, all key challenges for operators today.”

As demand grows for higher tonnages and drier filter cakes, equipment suppliers are scaling up and automating dewatering technologies. While pressure filtration is often the default technology, centrifugal and vacuum filtration can offer viable more cost-effective and higher-capacity alternatives.

Beca’s equipment selection process is grounded in strong relationships with vendors and test laboratories.

“We explore options such as modified drainage characteristics, staged filtering and slurry additives,” Language said. “Ultimately, the solution developed by Beca is a seamless system integration of dewatering, storage and conveying.

“Our differentiator in producing drier filter cake is the understanding of creating a durable drystack in tropical and wet climates, adding to the stability of landforms over time.”

Tailings deposition can often be treated as an operational afterthought, leading to poor water recovery and inefficient use of storage capacity. This can create significant challenges during closure and long-term maintenance.

And that’s why Beca takes a proactive approach.

“Our hands-on approach to leveraging technical knowledge of rheology together with practical constraints of safety and operability of deposition systems is a key strength,” Beca market director resources and sustainable fuels Matt Kebbell said.

Regulatory and environmental pressures are driving the need to minimise surface tailings storage and explore repurposing opportunities. Beca is at the forefront of developing high-strength applications for tailings, including concrete, building materials, and engineered backfill.

“Our innovation includes modifying particle size distribution through agglomeration and sizing, and separating particles in slurry form for use in high-consolidation applications,” Language said.

“These processes also enable the recovery of trace minerals, adding further value.”

Mine closures are becoming more complex and costly, often exceeding planned budgets and timelines. With increasing commodity volatility and climate-related risks, early integration of closure planning is essential.

“Our multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists and metallurgists embed closure strategies from the earliest design stages.” Musgrave said. “We provide ongoing operational advice and deliver closure solutions that address a wide range of technical scenarios, enabling compliance and long-term sustainability.”

Delivering technically challenging tailings projects requires deep insight and a balanced focus on immediate needs and long-term outcomes. Beca excels in managing complex brownfield projects, earning trust from regulators, communities and operators.

“Our project leads bring passion and experience, ensuring practical solutions that meet today’s challenges while preparing for future closure and compliance,” Musgrave said.

“With over 4500 engineers, planners, environmental scientists, project managers and commercial specialists, we’re ready to form the core of your tailings team, working alongside your in-house experts and other specialists.”

This project formed part of the requirement to secure permitting for a new mine and mineral processing plant, with a key condition: surface tailings storage to be minimised and no additional surface storage permitted beyond the first five years of operation.

Stage 1: A desktop study identified large-volume re-use options to reduce surface tailings storage.

Stage 2: Selected concepts were developed to pre-feasibility level, supported by laboratory testing.

The adopted solution included a portion of the tailings to be agglomerated and sized to achieve a coarse particle fraction which would result in an ideal packing density and hence high compacted strength.

The concept was tested by producing a “synthetic aggregate” from tailings that utilised a low-carbon, high-strength cement alternative (geopolymer). This was blended with the bulk of tails resulting in backfill mixes with high comprehensive strengths (greater than 4MPa). Geopolymer binders – made from industrial by-products – were activated with a basic solution. This matrix resulted in the total “non-tailings” material addition (binder) to the backfill of less than 15 per cent, a reduction of 40 per cent over traditional backfill tailings approaches.

The net benefit for the project was threefold: 70 per cent reduction in surface tailings storage; 90 per cent lower CO2 emissions from binder use; mine life extended by almost 50 per cent.

The project is now in final design and expected to move into execution in the near future.",0.9,0
rare earth,"Hydropower, Energy Dominance, And Tribal Rights - CleanTechnica",https://cleantechnica.com/2025/11/30/hydropower-energy-dominance-and-tribal-rights/,"The US government has declared an “energy emergency,” a pretext it is using to sweep aside any and all impediments to its “drill, baby, drill” mania. In truth, there is no energy emergency. The US is now the largest producer of fossil fuels in the world and is using its weaponized tariff strategy to force other nations to buy more of its oil and methane.

In 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) put a rule in place that allowed tribes to veto hydropower projects on their land. According to *[E&E News]( the original FERC policy was adopted after the body rejected seven preliminary permits for proposed hydropower projects that would have been located within Navajo Nation land. Commissioners said at the time that they “will not issue preliminary permits for projects proposing to use Tribal lands if the Tribe on whose lands the project is to be located opposes the permit.”

Last month, [Energy Secretary Chris Wright]( asked FERC to reverse the rule, claiming it is not compatible with a grid that needs to grow as quickly as possible. And why is such rapid growth needed? So America can win the race to build the most data centers in the world, powered by anything but wind or solar. “For America to continue dominating global energy markets, we must remove unnecessary burdens to the development of critical infrastructure, including hydropower projects,” Wright wrote.

America’s native tribes see the requested shift in policy as yet another attempt by the Great White Father to shove his fist down their throats. In a response to Wright’s proposal, they claimed it would trample on their rights while not doing much to encourage new hydropower development.

Amy Trainer, the director of environmental policy for the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community in Washington state, wrote in a comment that removing tribal veto authority would “invite speculative filings” and would “undermine the government’s credibility as a trustee and partner to Tribal Nations. Far from expediting hydropower development, such a rule would create unnecessary delays and uncertainty, diverting attention from projects that could advance with Tribal support.”

“In conversations we’ve had with investors, the need to get renewable capacity online as quickly as possible was often pitted against the need to engage with Indigenous peoples,” said Kate Finn, executive director of the Tallgrass Institute, which promotes Indigenous sovereignty. “What we say is the reality is that the need for energy doesn’t have to be in opposition to engagement with Indigenous people. There’s a way to include Indigenous perspectives in a meaningful way.” That would be news to Chris Wright.

The Tallgrass Institute recently partnered with Trillium Asset Management to create a report that sets forth the best practices that would allow investors to engage with Native American tribes before embarking on projects that affect their lands. Some of the ideas proposed in that report include conducting due diligence on projects, being transparent with tribal partners, building relationships, and finding structures to share benefits.

In other words, don’t just ride into town with a list of demands. Engage with the communities most affected to forge partnerships. It is hard to imagine that global energy dominance is high on the list of priorities for most tribal organizations, but preserving what little is left of tribal lands may well be.

Native American land constitutes just 2 percent of total US territory but has about 6 percent of the country’s renewable energy resource potential. Investors are scouring the landscape, looking for every available opportunity to build new projects, so many of them could be located on tribal lands. The report said that the consultation step isn’t just about respect, it can also “support efficient capital flow to projects that are more likely to be successful in the long term.”

Sada Geuss, an investment manager with Trillium, said the report was part of a push to avoid negative practices from extractive industries and ensure that tribes can take some benefits to projects. Even though the Trump administration has encouraged energy dominance above all else, Geuss said that investors would still benefit from consulting before embarking on projects.

“There’s a lot of movement back and forth around engagement, about environmental issues and about land use more broadly,” she said. “We’re trying to get companies to think more holistically with a long term view for the best practices. Just complying with what the current administration is doing does not set you up for success in a future administration.”

When the current policy was put in place, it was hailed by the tribes as an important step toward giving them more say over energy projects that could affect their land or spiritual sites. However, it was never formally adopted via the normal rule making process. Wright claims it makes it harder to build energy projects, totally ignoring the fact that this administration has cancelled permits and eliminated incentives for large-scale renewable energy projects.

If there really is an [energy emergency]( those projects would be pushed to the front of the queue, instead of focusing on other forms of energy that are much more expensive and take forever and a day to complete.

Wright wrote that FERC had “effectively delegated its exclusive statutory authority to issue preliminary permits to third parties.” The National Hydropower Association agrees wit him. It wrote in comments that his proposal would preserve “the ability for developers to protect their early investment in a proposed project … while the developer conducts the important work of consulting with federal and state regulators, Indian Tribes, and other interested parties.”

Most preliminary permit objections, the group wrote, “necessarily rest on a dearth of information. Meeting load growth while maintaining reliability and resilience will require timely development of new generation, and hydropower is uniquely positioned to meet that need,” NHA added.

The tribes counter that consultation before the preliminary permit stage means better projects that respect their rights under the Federal Power Act. Jason Gobin, executive director of the Tulalip Tribes of the Pacific Northwest, wrote in a comment, “Our people, our traditions, our culture, our very survival is inextricably tied to the fate of our natural environment. We cannot afford any diminishment or circumvention to the protections of treaty resources at such a time they are at tremendous risk.”

### What’s The Hurry?

Tribes and their advocates also noted that FERC had moved with undue haste to accommodate the energy secretary, without any consultation with the tribes that would be most affected by the change in policy. They were given just two weeks for comments after Wright claimed the need to reduce energy project delays was “urgent.”

The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, based in Nevada, wrote that the proposed change was a “plain violation of Tribal sovereignty” and that the quick process made it “very difficult and likely impossible for many impacted Tribes to provide timely comments on this adverse proposal.”

Speaking to reporters recently, FERC Chair Laura Swett said that her staff is “reviewing the comments we’ve received now, and we will certainly take every request into account, including the one to extend the deadline.” Maybe. And maybe the fix is in and the tribes are going to be told to shut up and go away — again.

Hydro projects take a long time to bring online — [dams don’t just appear overnight]( Only nuclear generating stations take longer to bring online. By contrast, solar power installations in particular are quickest to complete and can start providing power years before hydro ever could.

So, why are renewables getting such determined pushback from the current administration? Having a chief executive who believes renewables are a scam probably has a lot to do with it. Readers are encouraged to share any other ideas in the comments section.

tesla,Here's What Tesla's New Range of Affordable Electric Cars Cost - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/home/electric-vehicles/heres-what-teslas-new-range-of-affordable-electric-cars-cost/,"What you get with the stripped-down Model Y and Model 3.

Tesla has launched a range of more affordable [electric cars](/home/electric-vehicles/best-ev-electric-car/) -- stripped-back versions of the [refreshed Model Y](/home/electric-vehicles/teslas-model-y-redesign-has-arrived-but-maybe-not-where-you-are/) and [Model 3](/home/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-3-refreshed-with-new-look-longer-range/). These pared-down EVs lower the starting cost, making it easier for more people to own a Tesla.

This change is long overdue. As someone who's spent plenty of time behind the wheel of both cars, I see it as a move that could significantly boost Tesla ownership.

The idea is simple: Make the same design and driving experience accessible to more people by eliminating the extras that most owners rarely use. In my view, that's a smart move.

It comes at a time when electric vehicle shoppers will be seeking more affordable options. According to June figures from [Kelley Blue Book]( the average new vehicle transaction price in the US sits at $49,077, while EVs cost $57,245 on average. That's lower than the market peak in December 2023, but it's still about $10,500 higher than five years ago.

## How much do Tesla's cheaper cars cost, and what do they come with?

The Model Y Standard Rear-Wheel Drive starts at $39,990 and delivers an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, a 0-60 mph time of 6.8 seconds and a peak charging rate of 225 kW. It's powered by a 69 kWh battery and produces about 300 horsepower. This version uses one fewer battery module than the higher trims and is 5% more efficient than the Model Y RWD.

Inside, it features an open-concept center console similar to the Cybertruck, as well as textile doors and dashboard trim. The 10-way driver and four-way passenger seat controls are now managed via the touchscreen, eliminating the need for physical buttons.

Tesla includes a seven-speaker audio system, auto high beams and dual-tone textile and vegan leather seats, but most of the cabin adjustments are manual. That includes the seats, steering wheel and mirrors. The front seats are heated, while the rear ones are not.

*Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.* [*Add CNET*]( *as a preferred Google source.*

The rear passenger screen has been removed, but the car still includes a mobile charger. The glass roof is now closed internally with a fabric headliner for improved insulation, and the mirrors are manually folding. Also, there's no HEPA filter, only a particulate and odor filter.

The Model Y Standard comes standard with 18-inch wheels, with 19-inch wheels available as an optional upgrade, and offers 75 cubic feet of cargo space. Towing capacity is 3,500 pounds, and curb weight is 4,061 pounds. It supports Tesla's well-established Supercharging network and can add up to 160 miles in about 15 minutes. This version is available in three colors: stealth gray, pearl multicoat white and diamond black.

Meanwhile, the Model 3 Standard Rear-Wheel Drive now starts at $36,990 and shares many of the same hardware and software characteristics. It has the same 69 kWh battery, delivers 321 miles of EPA range and accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds thanks to 286 horsepower.

Tesla has added a front bumper camera with a washer like the Model Y, uses vegan leather and textile seating and has touchscreen-controlled seat adjustments instead of physical switches. There are manual second-row folding seats, a manual-adjust steering wheel and mirrors and no rear heated seats or ventilation.

It retains the glass panoramic roof but has acoustic front door glass and tempered rear glass. The rear screen has been removed, and the center console now features uncovered cupholders. It also features a 7-speaker audio setup and the same 15.4-inch touchscreen that dominates the interior.

Charging speeds are identical at up to 225 kW, and Tesla claims up to 170 miles of range can be added in 15 minutes. It weighs 3,759 pounds and has 24 cubic feet of cargo space. This trim offers the same three paint choices as the more expensive options.

Both cars ship with manual second-row air vents, ditch the LED strips in favor of footwell and door-pocket ambient lighting only, and come with standard LED headlights with auto adaptive high beams (no matrix LEDs). Interestingly, they also omit Autosteer, although they come with traffic-aware cruise control as standard.

[Full Self-Driving]( is optional, available for $8,000 or via a $99 monthly subscription. Tesla is offering the same four trim levels for each model: Standard, Premium RWD, Premium AWD and Performance.

I think this new approach makes a lot of sense for Tesla. Instead of chasing the luxury end of the market, this brings the focus back to what originally made the brand so popular: offering long-range, fast-charging, affordable electric vehicles that still feel cutting-edge. By trimming back on extras, the company has created an option that could appeal to first-time EV buyers who might otherwise look at cheaper rivals.

In my experience, Tesla's biggest strength has always been its software and driving dynamics, and those remain intact here. For anyone on the fence about making the switch to an EV, these new versions of the Model 3 and Model Y could be the most convincing reason yet.

Pricing for the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990, while the Model 3 Standard follows closely behind at $36,990. Global pricing has not yet been announced, but expect it to also undercut the existing Long Range model.

For now, this is the most accessible way to buy a Tesla.

tesla,Watch how a Tesla with Full Self-Driving handles being run off the road - CarExpert,https://www.carexpert.com.au/car-news/watch-how-a-tesla-with-full-self-driving-handles-being-run-off-the-road,"Wonder how a Tesla with Full Self-Driving would handle a dangerous and aggressive driver trying to run it off the road? Wonder no more.

**Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised)** system is an impressive bit of technology, able to handle day-to-day driving – including everything from slow-moving traffic and roundabouts – with surprising ease. But how does it handle trickier stuff?

In a US video aptly called *We Tried To Crash Into A Self Driving Tesla*, YouTuber *Dirty Tesla* – in collaboration with *Out of Spec**Reviews* – took a [Model Y](/tesla/model-y) to a closed course and threw everything it could at it.

Another driver in a former Ford Crown Victoria police car tailgated the Model Y, cut it off, drove at it head-on, brake-checked it, and even tried to side-swipe it and run it off the road.

***CarExpert can save you thousands on a new car. Click*** [***here***](/buy/) ***to get a great deal.***

*Dirty Tesla* found FSD (Supervised) version 14.1.7, in the most aggressive ‘Mad Max’ drive profile, had extremely quick reaction times and would brake decisively. Unlike a human, it also wasn’t rattled by another driver tailgating it or speeding past it.

Surprisingly, it even turned the vehicle around when it detected trouble ahead.

It wasn’t perfect, though, showing great reluctance to drive onto grass to avoid a dangerous vehicle – with the driver noting it was “scared” of going off-road.

When the driver attempted to override FSD by pushing the accelerator while on grass, on a couple of occasions it put the Model Y into Park.

You can view the full video above.

Tesla made FSD (Supervised) available in Australia in September, priced at $10,100 upfront or via a $149/month subscription. It’s available only in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles with Hardware 4 (HW4) cameras.

tesla,"Elon Musk opens up to Nikhil Kamath about philanthropy, says donating money is ‘extremely challenging’ - livemint.com",https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/elon-musk-nikhil-kamath-wtf-podcast-about-philanthropy-says-donating-money-is-extremely-challenging-11764561431540.html,"# Elon Musk opens up to Nikhil Kamath about philanthropy, says donating money is ‘extremely challenging’

## Talking about the Musk Foundation, the Tesla CEO told Nikhil Kamath on the WTF Podcast that the biggest challenge for the charity is to give the money away in a way that actually benefits people.

Elon Musk, the richest person in the world, has opened up about his take on charity and philanthropy, calling the art of giving “very hard” and full of challenges.

In an interview with [Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath]( on his WTF Podcast, Musk said that while philanthropy is necessary to help fellow humans, it's not an easy job.

He was replying to a question by Nikhil Kamath, who asked about his take on philanthropy and charity.

“I think we should. I mean, I agree with the love of humanity, and we should definitely try to do things that help our fellow human beings. But it’s very hard,” he said on the WTF Podcast, which was released on YouTube on Sunday.

The Tesla CEO, whose net worth has remained above $400 billion for a while now, explained why it is difficult to give away money in real life.

“If you care about the reality of goodness rather than simply the perception of it, it’s extremely difficult to give away money well,” he said.

Talking about the Musk Foundation, the Tesla CEO told Nikhil Kamath on the [WTF Podcast]( that the biggest challenge for the charity is to give the money away in a way that actually benefits people.

“I have a large foundation, but I don’t put my name on it. In fact, I’ve said I don’t want my name on anything. The biggest challenge I find with the foundation is trying to give money away in a way that is truly beneficial to people,” Elon Musk said.

“It’s very easy to give money away in a way that creates the appearance of goodness. It is very difficult—extremely difficult—to give money away for the reality of goodness,” he added.

Musk has in the past been skeptical about donating money as well.

“I think if you care about the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it, philanthropy is extremely difficult,” he told Chris Anderson in 2022.

## How much does Elon Musk donate to charity?

According to a report by *Bloomberg* in November this year, [Elon Musk]( donated a record $474 million to charity in 2024. The vast majority of the donations went to the entities controlled by him.

About $370 million in funds of the Musk Foundation, Elon Musk's charity, went to Foundation — a nonprofit set up by the Tesla CEO to establish a STEM-focussed primary and secondary school, according to tax filings cited by *Bloomberg*.

tesla,Market Data - TheStreet,https://www.thestreet.com/investing/for-now-maybe-through-holidays-stocks-should-move-ahead,"Here’s what to look for from markets in the last month of the year. Keep a keen eye on the Federal Reserve and tech.

* Major stock indices gained, with S&P 500 ending near its 52-week high.

* Market optimism was driven by Fed comments suggesting possible rate cuts and economic slowdown concerns.

* An end-of-year rally may continue unless disrupted by major events or shocks.

Out of nowhere, on a holiday week no less, it seemed the stock market got a bid.

The result was weekly gains for all the major averages. The Standard & Poor’s 500 ended about 1% below its 52-week high, and Eli Lilly ended the week still sporting a market capitalization of $1 trillion.

In the process, the pharmaceutical giant joined [Berkshire Hathaway]( as the only non-tech related companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more.

* Can the stock market continue its bullish run?

* What’s the outlook for December?

* Can we start to hazard a guess about 2026?

Theoretically, the run can continue its run this week and maybe into next week when the [Federal Reserve]( meets to discuss interest rates and the economy. The consensus (if the [CME]( Group’s FedWatch tool is an indicator) is a rate cut is probable.

Hawks push pause, doves seek cuts as traders mull rate-cut bet.

John Williams, a key Fed official (because he’s president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank), said the risks of an economic slowdown were bigger than more [inflation]( So, interest rate could come down.

Moreover, the [S&P 500]( (and the market generally) has just enjoyed five straight gains and ended Friday only 1% below its 6,920 all-time high reached on Oct. 29.

We should add the rally was basically prompted by Williams’ speech, given in Chile on Nov, 21.

As a result, something would have to derail the market. It would have to be an event: A shock runup in bond yields or oil prices, a terrorism attack, explosion in the Middle East or Ukraine, a sudden resignation no one expects.

TJX Companies store brands are overcoming a major headwind.

Could that mean the market could rally through to December as well? Maybe. There are only 22 trading days left in 2025. So, again, you need an abrupt, serious problem.

The market’s recent [pullback]( was set off by worries that Big Tech, especially Meta Platforms, Google-parent Alphabet, Tesla and Oracle, was investing too much money on artificial intelligence capacity. That is, huge data centers filled with racks of computers tied together with [AI]( chips.

That worry is probably still on many investors’ minds, but you won’t see it erupt again until the latter half of January when fourth-quarter earnings reports start.

This is not to deny the attention the recent market pullback received.  Through Nov. 20, the S&P 500 and fell 5.5% and the Nasdaq Composite fell more than 8% after hitting all-time highs on Oct. 29. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.5% from its all-time high, reached on Nov. 12.) The pullback was a surprise, and it actually did need a catalyst to calm investors.

The catalyst was John Williams’ speech.

His speech puts a floor under the market for now. And we wait for the Fed’s big event.

GM is continuing to right size its EV production.

November, normally one of the better months of the year, closed flat to modestly lower. [Nvidia]( was down 12.6%. Microsoft dropped 5%. Meta slipped 1%. Alphabet jumped almost 14%.

The S&P 500 and Dow were basically flat. The Nasdaq and Nasdaq-100 Index each fell about 1.5%.

Three interesting exceptions: Walmart jumped 9.2% in November. Berkshire Hathaway rose 7.6% as [Warren Buffett]( prepares to step down as CEO at the end of the month. [Costco]( Wholesale was up slightly, thanks to a 3.1% gain starting after Monday.

And interest rates mostly moved lower anticipating the Fed’s Dec. 10 decision. The 10-year Treasury bond was yielding about 4% on Friday, down from 4.6% when 2025 opened. The 30-year mortgage rate is just above 6.2%, down from 7.25% in January.

* The S&P 500 finished Friday up 16.45% for the year.

* The Nasdaq is up 21% for 2025.

* The Dow industrials are up 12.2%.

* The Russell 2000 Index is up 12.1%.

Part of the unease about the market in recent weeks has much to do with how the gains have been built.

Consider the S&P 500. About 49% of its 38.6% total return since the market bottom in April 2025 (stock price gain plus [dividends]( came just from the Magnificent Seven stocks: Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, according to S&P Senior Index analyst Howard Silverblatt.

When asked, Silverblatt said he didn’t believe the S&P 500’s total return in any period was so dominated by such a small group of stocks.

For the year to date, the index is up 17.8% on a total return basis. Without the Mag Seven stocks, the total return falls to 10.24%.

The latest round of earnings reports is winding up with just 111 companies reporting quarterly results this week. Here are the key reports:

* Credo Technology, maker of connectors for computer applications.

* Database developer MongoDB.

* Discount retailer DollarTree.

* Three Canadian banking giants: Toronto Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce

tesla,Another EV Charging Hub Running On Renewable Energy Launches In California - CleanTechnica,https://cleantechnica.com/2025/11/30/another-ev-charging-hub-running-on-renewable-energy-launches-in-california/,"It was just several days ago that I wrote an article about [Tesla launching]( a huge EV charging hub that runs on solar power. Today I found another one. Though, it actually launched a little before the Tesla one. It’s a new hub with 18 fast chargers for fleet vehicles. The [press release]( from Terawatt Infrastructure says the source of electricity is renewables. “Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session.”

The location is Rialto, California, about 56 miles east of Los Angeles. The new fleet charging hub provides:

* 24/7 security with 360-degree cameras and gated access to protect vehicles, cargo, and drivers.

For people who might think this new site is just a one-off, Terawatt opened a similarly sized hub [in April]( “The private site, shared among multiple fleets, will house a total of 20 pull-through and bobtail DC fast charging stalls and boast a capacity of 7MW — enabling charging for up to 125 trucks per day.”

But let’s get back to the [Rialto hub]( “The Rialto site brings Terawatt’s vision of a connected, electrified network to life. It provides fast, reliable, and high-speed pull-through charging along an electric lane that runs from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles through Vernon and Commerce, culminating in Rialto. Our network enables companies to reduce emissions and run a variety of routes across a number of vehicle classes with the confidence of a dependable charging solution. EV fleets can now travel further, more cleanly, without slowing down their operations,” said Neha Palmer, CEO and co-founder of Terawatt.

Solar power canopies generate electricity and don’t require vast amounts of land. They also provide shade and protection from precipitation.

There has been much good news about new EV charger installations lately, despite the loss of the federal EV incentives and a Trump administration that is anti-EV.

Using fully electric medium- and-heavy-duty freight trucks reduces harmful air pollution because they don’t burn diesel fuel or gasoline. There are some environmental benefits as well.

* In the five-county region of Southern California, **119,200 workers** are employed in the EV industry, which is 43.4 percent of all statewide jobs (275,600) in the EV industry.

* In California, the EV industry pays an average annual wage of $91,300, well above the average annual wage across all industries of $68,500.

[Elon Musk]( has shared a new, alarming video on social media that paints a world where humanoid robots slide into nearly every corner of our daily lives.

The clip features [Tesla's Optimus robot]( performing tasks ranging from physical labor to cooking. Musk paired the video with a sweeping promise that robots will raise global wealth and make work optional.

Musk reposted the 38-second video on his X profile, which was originally created by Alex Utopia and shows Tesla's humanoid robots doing a variety of everyday jobs. Since Musk posted the clip, it has racked up over 58.5 million views.

The montage shows Optimus walking down the street. It then cuts to a construction site where the robot supports workers. The clip shifts to a scene of Optimus providing emergency aid during a disaster drill. Next, you see Optimus inside a judo gym, sparring with a trainer.

After that, the robot appears on an urban police patrol. The tone shifts again when Optimus lands in a casino dealing cards at a blackjack table. Then you can see it walking on the beach, and then it is shown in a restaurant kitchen where it cooks a meal with professional chefs. The final shot shows Optimus back in a casino at a roulette table.

Musk has already shown Optimus folding laundry and walking in earlier demos. He continues to frame [humanoid robots]( as the solution for labor shortages tied to declining fertility rates.

Shortly after sharing the video, Musk spoke at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, where he argued that humanoid robots will reshape society. According to Musk, work will shift from a necessity to a hobby. He compared future jobs to gardening for fun rather than buying vegetables at a store.

Musk said he expects money to lose relevance as [artificial intelligence]( and robotics advance. He also claimed humanoid robots will become the biggest product in history. In his view, there is one clear path to universal wealth. He said AI and robotics can eliminate poverty and allow people to choose work only when it brings joy.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered a more cautious perspective. He agreed that jobs will change but noted that currency will continue to matter for the foreseeable future.

The world Elon Musk describes raises big questions about daily life. Robots that can cook, build and respond to emergencies could reshape our communities. They may also transform what people see as valuable work. Even if full robot integration is years away, companies like Tesla are already starting to show how quickly this tech can evolve. You may not see an Optimus on your street yet, but the direction is clear, and the pace is fast.

Musk's reposted montage video has pushed the conversation about humanoid robots into sharper focus. The video shows how close companies like Tesla want us to be to a future filled with robots that move, react and work alongside us. The reactions range from excitement to real concern, which shows how uneasy many feel about a world shaped by machines that can cook, patrol and even respond to emergencies. The speed of this progress is hard to ignore. Each new video hints at a future where robots handle more daily tasks and take on work that once needed human hands. Whether that future feels promising or unsettling will depend on how we prepare for it and how much control we keep as this technology grows.

This article pulls together the latest **news, analyst targets and algorithmic forecasts** to outline a grounded, data-backed **Intel stock price forecast for 2026** – and the key risks that could make or break that outlook.

> **Important:** This is **not** investment advice. It’s informational and educational only. Always do your own research or consult a licensed financial adviser before investing.

* **Price & performance:** Intel trades near **$40–41**, up roughly **100% year-to-date**, and close to new 52‑week highs (approx. $17.67–$42.48 range). [[3]](

* **Q3 2025 results:** Revenue in Q3 2025 was **$13.7 billion**, up 3% year‑over‑year. GAAP EPS swung from a **loss of $3.88** a year ago to **profit of $0.90**, while non‑GAAP EPS hit $0.23, with a sharp recovery in gross margins. [[4]](

* **Business mix:** Client computing (PC chips) grew 5% YoY to $8.5B, while Data Center & AI slipped 1% to $4.1B. Intel Foundry reported $4.2B in revenue and remains loss‑making but strategically crucial. [[5]](

These improving fundamentals, combined with highly visible political and strategic backing, set the stage for **2026 to be a “proof year”** for Intel’s turnaround – especially its foundry ambitions and AI roadmap.

In **August 2025**, Intel and the Trump administration agreed to convert CHIPS Act grants into an equity investment:

* The U.S. government is investing **$8.9 billion** into Intel common stock as part of a broader **$11.1 billion** support package. [[6]](

* The stake is about **9.9–10% of Intel’s shares**, structured as a passive ownership with no board representation. [[7]](

* **Upside:** De facto government backstop for foundry investments and fabs, which could reduce bankruptcy or capital‑access risk and support a premium valuation if the strategy works. [[8]](

* **Downside:** Political scrutiny over layoffs, offshoring and buybacks, plus the possibility of policy‑driven rather than purely profit‑driven decisions. Critics already argue the deal is a heavy-handed intervention in corporate governance. [[9]](

By 2026, markets will have a much clearer view of whether this “national champion” status is a valuation tailwind or a drag.

* **Nvidia** agreed to invest **$5 billion in Intel stock** and co‑develop multiple generations of custom data‑center and PC CPUs with Nvidia’s NVLink and GPU technology integrated. [[10]](

* **SoftBank Group** committed **$2 billion** for Intel shares at **$23 per share**, becoming one of Intel’s larger shareholders. [[11]](

Together with the U.S. stake, that’s roughly **$15+ billion in new equity capital** anchored by major strategic and financial players.

* Signal that **AI hyperscalers and capital allocators believe Intel’s 18A and future nodes can be competitive**.

* Bolster the balance sheet and reduce funding risk for Intel’s massive fab build‑out in Arizona, Ohio and elsewhere. [[12]](

* Lay the groundwork for **multi‑year revenue ramps** in AI infrastructure, potentially becoming visible in earnings models by 2026.

The single biggest catalyst behind Intel’s recent Black Friday surge was a familiar name: **Apple**.

* Supply‑chain analyst **Ming‑Chi Kuo** said the odds of Apple using Intel as an **advanced‑node supplier for M‑series chips** have “improved significantly”, with shipments possibly starting in **2027**. [[13]](

* Kuo reports that Apple has a **non‑disclosure agreement** and is waiting on Intel’s **18A PDK 1.0/1.1**, expected in early 2026 – a key milestone in proving Intel’s process readiness. [[14]](

* Intel stock jumped **over 10%** on the rumor, becoming the best‑performing stock in the S&P 500 on Black Friday. [[15]](

If Intel delivers stable 18A silicon and Apple signs on in 2026 for 2027 production, the market could start **pricing in multi‑billion‑dollar foundry revenues** long before chips ship. That’s a key part of bullish 2026 price targets.

A widely circulated TradingNews analysis highlights comments by Elon Musk that Tesla “might do something with Intel,” fuelling speculation that Intel could produce future AI5 chips for robotaxis and robotics. [[16]](

While no formal deal has been announced, the **Tesla rumor reinforces a broader narrative**: if Intel can win *any* large AI chip customers besides Nvidia and potential Apple work, its foundry could move toward break‑even **around late 2026**, a milestone several bullish models are baking in. [[17]](

The other big storyline heading into 2026 is **intensifying competition with TSMC** and the legal risk around talent moves.

* TSMC has sued former senior executive **Wei‑Jen Lo**, who joined Intel in 2025, alleging breach of contract and potential leakage of trade secrets. Prosecutors in Taiwan have raided his homes and seized devices as part of a probe. [[18]](

* Intel strongly denies any wrongdoing and stresses that it prohibits the transfer of confidential third‑party IP, backing Lo in internal memos. [[19]](

This case underscores the stakes: with Intel now backed by the U.S. government and vying to repatriate leading‑edge manufacturing, **any misstep on IP or export controls could trigger sanctions, fines or reputational damage**, affecting valuations in 2026.

* **TradingView** aggregates a **12‑month consensus target around $38.30**, with a high of $52 and a low of $24. [[20]](

* **Benzinga** reports a lower consensus target of **$31.20** from 32 analysts, again with a wide range from **$20 (bearish)** to **$52 (bullish)**. [[21]](

* **MarketBeat** data cited in a recent feature notes an average target of about **$34.84**, with the Street‑high target at **$52**, well below the post‑rally spot price near $40–41. [[22]](

* **Most analysts still model Intel in the mid‑30s**, implying *downside* from current levels.

* A **smaller group of bulls** sees upside toward the low‑50s – roughly **25–30% above** recent prices – based on a successful turnaround and higher AI/foundry contribution by 2026. [[23]](

Since these are **12‑month** targets set in late 2025, they effectively cover an investment horizon stretching well into **late 2026**, making them a good benchmark for “base‑case” expectations.

Beyond human analysts, several services publish **model‑driven Intel price predictions** that explicitly extend into 2026. They often disagree sharply – a useful reminder of how uncertain the path is.

* That implies only around **+4–5%** upside from the current ~$40.56 base, but allows for sizable swings. [[24]](

This sits broadly in line with **cautious Wall Street targets** and assumes a slow, steady re‑rating.

Crypto‑style data platform **CoinCodex**, which also models stocks, paints a more pessimistic picture:

* It expects Intel to **fall to about $23.61 in one year**, a drop of roughly 40% from current prices.

* Its long‑term model indicates the **highest expected price by 2026 is around $45.34**, suggesting limited upside beyond the mid‑40s. [[25]](

CoinCodex’s technical dashboard currently labels sentiment as **“bullish”** in the short term, but its longer‑term algorithm still flags Intel as “not a good stock to buy” based on projected declines. [[26]](

At the other extreme, **LongForecast** – which uses a proprietary quantitative model – projects Intel could trade in the **$70–$90+ range during parts of 2026**, with December 2026 levels around the low **$90s**. That would more than **double the current price**, but with large month‑to‑month volatility. [[27]](

These numbers are **far above most analyst targets**, and should be treated as a highly speculative scenario rather than consensus.

A detailed 2025 analysis from TradingNews lays out one of the more concrete 2026 valuation frameworks:

* It highlights Intel’s **doubling in 2025 to around $44**, Nvidia’s $5B stake, the U.S. government’s $8.9B investment, SoftBank’s $2B, and potential Tesla and Apple chip work. [[28]](

* The authors argue this capital and partnership stack, combined with cost cuts and EPS recovery, justify a **12‑month target of $55–$60**.

This is a **clearly bullish scenario**, but it aligns with the idea that if Intel executes well, 2026 could see **a structural re‑rating** rather than just cyclical improvement.

Regardless of which numerical forecast you prefer, **most models key off a similar set of fundamentals**. Here are the levers that will matter most to Intel’s stock price in 2026:

* Intel’s Q3 2025 results emphasize the ramp of its **18A process** (and future 14A) across both CPUs and foundry customers, with Fab 52 in Arizona now fully operational. [[30]](

* Apple’s and other potential customers’ decisions in **2026** will hinge on the maturity and power/performance of these nodes. Delays or yield issues could quickly undercut bullish forecasts.

* Intel Foundry generated **$4.2 billion in revenue** last quarter but remains heavily loss‑making. [[31]](

* Bearish or cautious models assume the foundry continues to **bleed billions**, forcing Intel either to absorb ongoing losses or restructure again.

* The AI server market is enormous and still growing fast; Nvidia and Intel frame their collaboration as targeting a **$150 billion‑plus market**, with x86 CPUs playing a major role. [[32]](

* The extent to which Intel captures this demand – vs. remaining a secondary supplier – will heavily influence **earnings power by 2026**.

* Intel’s Client Computing Group is already growing again (+5% YoY in Q3), benefiting from AI PC refresh cycles and new **Panther Lake** architecture on 18A. [[33]](

* If AI PCs become a real secular upgrade cycle through 2026, they can provide **steady, high‑margin cash flow** that supports foundry investments.

* The combined **government, Nvidia and SoftBank equity stakes** bolster Intel’s capital position but also **increase share count** and entangle the company in political priorities. [[34]](

* How markets feel about this by 2026 – as a safety net or as “government overhang” – will influence the valuation multiple.

Given the wide dispersion of forecasts, it helps to think in scenarios rather than single‑point predictions.

* 18A proves competitive; early 14A roadmap looks credible.

* Nvidia collaboration ramps; Intel lands at least one significant **additional AI or automotive customer** (e.g., Tesla or another hyperscaler). [[35]](

* Foundry losses shrink sharply, and investors believe in a path to **$10–12B foundry revenue by 2027**. [[37]](

* The market to award a more typical **15–18x earnings multiple** (ex‑foundry adjustments), which underpins the **$65–$70** type 2026 targets seen in bullish research. [[39]](

* The turnaround continues, but more slowly than bulls hope.

* AI and PC trends are positive, but Intel remains a **challenger** rather than a clear share‑gainer.

* The foundry moves toward smaller losses, but break‑even slips beyond 2026.

* **Low‑40s:** consistent with StockScan’s average 2026 forecast (~$42) and some conservative analyst targets. [[40]](

* **High‑40s to low‑50s:** If sentiment stays constructive and 18A progress is visible, Intel could trade closer to the top end of consensus price‑target ranges (~$50–52). [[41]](

* Yield or delay problems at 18A/14A cause **customer hesitation or cancellations**.

* Macro or AI spending slows, hurting data‑center demand and making the foundry economics even worse.

This is closer to **CoinCodex’s one‑year forecast** of ~$23.61 and its view that Intel’s stock could struggle to hold current levels by late 2026. [[43]](

1. **Execution risk:** Intel’s recent history is full of missed timelines. Any further slip in 18A or 14A would directly undermine the foundry strategy, analyst confidence and multiples. [[44]](

2. **Geopolitical risk:** Intel sits at the heart of U.S.–China tech tensions and domestic industrial policy. Export controls, sanctions or policy shifts could affect both demand and cost structures. [[45]](

3. **Legal/IP risk:** The TSMC lawsuit around Wei‑Jen Lo highlights how aggressively rivals will defend IP – and how sensitive regulators are to trade secrets in the chip sector. [[46]](

4. **Government overhang:** With the U.S. government holding nearly 10% of Intel, future debates over layoffs, labor conditions, or offshoring could lead to **political interventions that markets dislike**. [[47]](

5. **AI cycle normalization:** If AI infrastructure spending normalizes faster than expected, or if competitors like TSMC, Samsung, AMD or ARM‑based players erode Intel’s share more than models assume, 2026 revenue and margins could disappoint.

+ The stock has already doubled in 2025 and now trades above many published 12‑month price targets. [[48]](

+ Traditional analysts cluster around **mid‑30s to low‑40s** a year out, modestly below or just above current levels. [[49]](

+ See Intel as a **leveraged AI and reshoring play**, where successful execution on 18A and foundry economics could justify **$65–$70** and beyond by 2026. [[50]](

+ Highlight ongoing execution and dilution risk, with some algorithms projecting the stock back toward the **mid‑20s** or worse if the turnaround disappoints. [[51]](

* The **2026 outcome band is unusually wide**, spanning from deep downside to substantial upside, and depends heavily on technical milestones and political decisions.

* Position sizing, diversification, and time horizon are crucial: Intel may fit best as one piece of a broader **semiconductor or AI basket** rather than a single‑name bet – especially if your thesis is focused on 2026.

Again, this article is **not investment advice**. But if you’re watching Intel into 2026, the **numbers to watch** will be:

Those will likely move the stock far more than any single algorithmic price prediction.

tesla,Considering Buying a $20K Home Robot? There's Something You Need to Know First - CNET,https://www.cnet.com/tech/considering-buying-a-20k-home-robot-theres-something-you-need-to-know-first/,"This robot is designed to do your chores for you -- but it might need some help from a remote operator.

Connor is a technology writer and editor, with a byline on multiple platforms. He has been writing for around nine years now across the web and in print too. Connor has attended the biggest tech expos, including CES, MWC, and IFA -- with contributions as a judge on panels at them. He's also been interviewed as a technology expert on TV and radio by national news outlets including France24. Connor has experience with most major platforms, though does hold a place in his heart for macOS, iOS/iPadOS, electric vehicles, and smartphone tech. Just like everyone else around here, he's a fan of gadgets of all sorts. Aside from writing, Connor is involved in the startup and venture capital scene, which puts him at the front of new and exciting tech -- he is always on the lookout for innovative products.

The robot stands 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighs as much as a golden retriever and is nearly the price of a brand-new budget car. This is [Neo]( the [humanoid robot](/tech/computing/a-softer-humanoid-robot-for-the-home/).

Billed as a personal assistant you can talk to and eventually rely on to handle everyday tasks, Neo could load your dishwasher and fold your laundry.

But it doesn't come cheap: It'll cost you $20,000. And even then, you'll still need to train this new home bot, and it possibly requires remote assistance as well.

If that still sounds enticing, preorders are now open (for $200 down). You'll be signing up as an early adopter for what Neo's maker, a California-based company called 1X, is calling a ""consumer-ready humanoid."" That's opposed to other humanoids under development from the likes of [Tesla](/videos/analyzing-the-details-in-teslas-latest-optimus-robot-demo/) and [Figure](/tech/computing/ai-brains-in-a-humanoid-robot-meet-figure-02/), which are, for the moment at least, more focused on factory environments.

Neo is a whole order of magnitude different from [robot vacuums](/home/kitchen-and-household/best-robot-vacuum/) like those from Roomba, Eufy and Ecovacs, and embodies a long-running sci-fi fantasy of robot maids and butlers [doing chores](/tech/services-and-software/ai-and-robots-that-do-your-household-chores-dream-on-folks/) and picking up after us. If this is the future, read on for more of what's in store.

*Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.* [*Add CNET*]( *as a preferred Google source.*

The pitch from 1X is that Neo can do all manner of household chores: fold laundry, run a vacuum, tidy shelves and bring in the groceries. It can open doors, climb stairs and even act as a home entertainment system.

Neo appears to move smoothly, with a soft, almost human-like gait, thanks to 1X's tendon-driven motor system that gives it gentle motion and impressive strength. The company says it can lift up to 154 pounds and carry 55 pounds, but it is quieter than a refrigerator. It's covered in soft materials and neutral colors, making it look less intimidating than metallic prototypes from other companies.

The company says Neo has a 4-hour runtime. Its hands are IP68-rated, meaning they're submersible in water. It can connect via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and 5G. For conversation, it has a built-in large language model (LLM), the same sort of [AI technology](/tech/services-and-software/best-ai-chatbots/) that powers [ChatGPT](/tech/services-and-software/what-is-chatgpt-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/) and [Gemini](/tech/services-and-software/what-is-gemini-everything-you-should-know-about-googles-ai-tool/).

The primary way to control the Neo robot will be by speaking to it, just as if it were a person.

Still, Neo's usefulness today depends heavily on how you define useful. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern got an [up-close look at Neo]( at 1X's headquarters and found that, at least for now, it's largely teleoperated, meaning a human often operates it remotely using a [virtual-reality headset](/news/best-vr-headset-sem/) and controllers.

""I didn't see Neo do anything autonomously, although the company did share a video of Neo opening a door on its own,"" Stern wrote last week. 1X CEO Bernt Børnich reportedly told her that Neo will do most things autonomously in 2026, though he also acknowledged that the quality ""may lag at first.""

The company's FAQ says that if there's a chore request Neo doesn't know how to accomplish, you can schedule an expert from 1X to help the robot ""learn while getting the job done.""

Part of what early adopters are signing up for is to allow Neo to learn from their environment, so that future versions can operate more independently.

That learning process raises questions about privacy and trust. The robot uses a mix of visual, audio and contextual intelligence -- meaning it can see, hear and remember interactions with you in your home.

""If you buy this product, it is because you're OK with that social contract,"" Børnich told the Journal. ""It's less about Neo instantly doing your chores and more about you helping Neo learn to do them safely and effectively.""

Neo's reliance on human operation behind the scenes prompted a response from John Carmack, a computer industry luminary known for his work with VR systems and the lead programmer of classic video games, including Doom and Quake.

""Companies selling the dream of autonomous household humanoid robots today would be better off embracing reality and selling 'remote operated household help',"" he wrote in a [post on the X social network](

1X says it's taking steps to protect your privacy: Neo listens only when it recognizes it's being addressed, and its cameras will blur out humans. You can restrict Neo from entering or viewing specific areas of your home, and the robot will never be teleoperated without owner approval, the company says.

But inviting an AI-equipped humanoid to observe your home life isn't a small step.

The first units are expected to ship to customers in the US in 2026. There is a $499 monthly subscription alternative to the $20,000 full purchase price, although it will be available at an unspecified later date. A broader international rollout is promised for 2027.

Neo's got a long road ahead of it to live up to the expectations set by Rosie the Robot in The Jetsons way back when. But this is no Hanna-Barbera cartoon. What we're seeing now is a much more tangible harbinger of change.

Hyundai Motor Group will launch Korea's first vehicle-to-grid pilot on Jeju Island using Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9

[Facebook](   [Twitter](   [LinkedIn](   [Share via Email](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#043b7771666e616770394c7d716a60656d2f617c74656a60772f52365c2f776176726d6761772f6567766b77772f706c7661612f6965766f617077226569743f666b607d396c707074772137452136422136427373732a6571706b696b706d7261736b7668602a676b69213642213742742137403031303d3737)

Hyundai Motor Group is expanding its vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services across Korea, Europe and the United States, enabling electric vehicles to store, supply and share electricity with power grids and homes. The rollout includes vehicle-to-grid (V2G) pilots in Korea and the Netherlands, alongside vehicle-to-home (V2H) services in the US.

In Korea, the group will launch the country’s first V2G pilot service on Jeju Island by the end of 2025, using Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9 models. The initiative addresses Jeju’s renewable energy oversupply by leveraging EVs as flexible grid resources that can return stored electricity to the grid.

Participants can charge their vehicles when energy prices are low and discharge electricity when prices rise through Jeju’s real-time energy market. Korea Electric Power Corporation will facilitate integration into the distribution grid, while Hyundai Engineering will analyse charging station operations.

“V2G services are expected to provide EV customers with a new mobility experience related to their energy life,” Hokeun Chung, Executive Vice President of Future Strategy Division at Hyundai Motor Group, said.

In the Netherlands, Hyundai Motor Group will introduce a commercial V2G service building on the smart charging (V1G) service launched earlier in 2025. Customer recruitment will begin at the end of 2025, with the service initially available for Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9 models before expanding to other vehicles.

In the US, the group will launch V2H services enabling EVs to provide emergency power during natural disasters and routine outages. Hyundai Motor will introduce V2H functionality with Ioniq 9, while Kia expands its offering to include EV6.

Stream on an 11-inch 90Hz display with quad Dolby Atmos speakers.

If you’ve been waiting for Cyber Monday to get a cheap Samsung tablet, your wait is over – and we’re not talking about the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra which costs almost $1,000 with premium specs. Instead, we’re talking about a budget-friendly Galaxy Tab A9+ model that can handle everyday tasks without breaking the bank. Amazon [has cut the price of this 64GB/WiFi version from $219 to $139]( which makes it a great deal for an 11-inch tablet that can do a lot of things.

The **Tab A9+ has an 11-inch TFT LCD panel with a resolution of 1920×1200** which makes text sharp enough to read and colors bright enough to stream video. The **90Hz refresh rate** makes scrolling through social media and web pages feel much smoother than standard 60Hz displays, and it adds a little bit of fluidity that makes the whole experience better.

**Dolby Atmos processing powers** the quad speakers on all four edges which give surprisingly strong sound and it **creates spatial sound** that makes movies, games, and music sound better than most tablets in this price range. The speakers make dialogue clear without muddiness and are loud enough to fill a small room. This audio setup turns the tablet into a portable entertainment device that doesn’t need external speakers or headphones to enjoy content fully.

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset and 4GB of RAM **work together to handle everyday tasks** like web browsing, email, social media, and streaming services without any annoying lag or stuttering. The 64GB of internal storage fills up quickly with apps, photos, and content that can be accessed offline. The good news is that there’s also a **microSD card slot can hold cards up to 1TB** which is a cheap way to add more storage.

With multi-window display, **you can run more than one app on the same screen** at the same time. For example, you can split the screen between a web browser and a note-taking app or watch YouTube while checking your email. This feature turns the tablet from a simple device for consuming content into a modest productivity tool that can handle basic work tasks or multitasking situations. **Samsung’s One UI interface makes Android 13** work better on larger screens by using gestures that are easy to understand and tablet-specific layouts that make better use of the space than phones that are blown up to tablet size.

With *Quick Share*, you can **move files between Samsung devices and even iOS devices with just a few taps**. This means you don’t have to email attachments or upload files to the cloud when you want to share photos or documents. You can charge the tablet with a USB-C cable and it usually lasts 8 to 10 hours of mixed use, like streaming, browsing, and light gaming, before you need to plug it in.

You can save $80 on a tablet that has really useful features at a low price by getting the Galaxy Tab A9+ for $139 instead of $219. For less than what many 8-inch tablets with worse specs cost, you get an 11-inch 90Hz display, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, decent performance for everyday tasks, and Samsung’s polished software experience.

# Roborock Q7 Max+ With 9 Weeks Self-Empty Crashes to Record Low, Cyber Monday Goes Zero Profit for Final Clearance

Our favorite mid-range robot vacuum, with a great docking station.

Roborock makes a lot more than just the high-end flagship $1000+ models that get a lot of attention in tech reviews and forums for fans. The brand makes cheaper models that still have important features like self-emptying docks and these are some of the best value options on the robot vacuum market.

For instance, the Q7 M5+ has 10,000Pa of suction, two brushes that don’t tangle, LiDAR navigation and a base that empties itself and holds up to seven weeks of debris – and it costs a lot less than some flagship models. The good news is that Amazon [has just cut the price of this combo to $219 for Cyber Monday, down from its usual price of $359]( and this is the lowest price ever.

The **RockDock Plus base station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin** into a sealed bag **that holds about seven to nine weeks’ worth of dirt, pet hair** and other debris, depending on how big your home is and how messy it is. Because of that extra space, you can basically forget about taking care of your vacuum for almost two months.

Instead of emptying dustbins after every cleaning session, you can just check in every so often to change bags. The sealed bag system keeps allergens and fine dust particles from getting into the air when you empty it by hand and it makes it perfect for homes with allergies or sensitivities. When the bag is full, you can quickly lift it up and put it back down again without making dust clouds or having to touch the dirt that has built up.

The **10,000Pa HyperForce suction picks up everything from fine dust on hardwood floors to pet hair** that has been stuck in carpets without needing to go over the same area more than once: That level of suction is comparable to models that cost twice as much, and it works well on all types of floors. Roborock made the dual anti-tangle system with JawScrapers’ main brush technology which stops hair from getting stuck in the roller and it also has a side brush that won’t get tangled even when cleaning up long human hair or shedding from double-coated dogs.

PreciSense LiDAR navigation makes precise floor plans of your home and shows where rooms and furniture are so that you can clean them more quickly. Unlike older models, **this vacuum doesn’t bump around your space at random** and instead, it follows planned paths that make sure it covers everything without going over the same area more than once. You can also use the Roborock app to set no-go zones so that the vacuum doesn’t go near pet food bowls, delicate rugs, or places with cables. Virtual walls make boundaries without needing to put up physical barriers.

This **combination vacuum and mop can pick up both dry and sticky messes** in one pass: It automatically switches between modes based on the type of floor and your preferences. With three adjustable water flow settings, you can choose how much water to use when mopping. For example, you can use light moisture on sealed hardwood or heavier flow on tile and laminate that can handle more water.

The vacuum works just as well on carpets as it does on hard floors because it automatically adjusts the suction power when it detects rugs or carpets and lowers it on hard surfaces to save battery life. The edge cleaning works well because the side brush can get into corners and along baseboards where dirt builds up. The **design is small enough to fit under furniture and around chair legs** which lets it get to places that upright vacuums can’t.

For $219, you can get the Roborock Q7 M5+ with its self-emptying dock and it is a great deal because similar systems from iRobot or Shark usually cost between $400 and $600. Here you can get a robot vacuum system that makes it easy to keep your floors clean every day.

tesla,"Autonomous & Self Driving Vehicle News: Pony.ai, Zoox and Tesla - AUTO Connected Car News",https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2025/11/autonomous-self-driving-vehicle-news-pony-ai-zoox-and-tesla/,"Pony.ai announced a major expansion of its partnership with Sunlight Mobility, adopting an asset-light model that allows the mobility platform to fund Pony.ai’s Gen-7 Robotaxi fleet. The first vehicles will launch in Guangzhou before the end of 2025, with broader rollout planned across additional Chinese cities.

The agreement deepens a collaboration that began in 2024 and reflects growing market confidence in Pony.ai’s Robotaxi business, as more third parties are willing to finance fleet deployments and lease the company’s Virtual Driver autonomous system.

Sunlight Mobility, which operates in more than 180 cities, will integrate the jointly operated autonomous fleet into both companies’ platforms, combining its digital mobility expertise with Pony.ai’s technology to enhance user experience, improve efficiency, and create shared economic benefits.

Panasonic Energy has signed a multi-year agreement to supply its advanced 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion battery cells to Zoox, Amazon’s autonomous ride-hailing subsidiary. Deliveries will begin in early 2026 to support Zoox’s growing purpose-built robotaxi fleet, now scaling production at its Hayward, CA facility and expanding service in cities such as Las Vegas.

The 2170 cells—known for high energy density, safety, and reliability—will initially ship from Japan, with future production planned at Panasonic Energy’s Kansas plant. Panasonic cites its record of supplying 20 billion cells without battery-related vehicle recalls as evidence of quality.

The partnership aligns with rapid growth in the robotaxi sector, with the U.S. market valued at $0.45B in 2024 and projected to grow more than 70% annually through 2030. Global robotaxi revenue is forecast to reach $40–50B by 2030.

Executives from both companies highlighted the collaboration as a milestone in advancing safer, cleaner, and scalable urban mobility.

Elon Musk announced that Tesla will “roughly double” its Robotaxi fleet in Austin next month, but the actual numbers reveal a major shortfall from Tesla’s own goals. Musk previously promised 500 Robotaxis in Austin by the end of the year, yet the current fleet is estimated at only about 30 vehicles. Doubling that would bring the total to roughly 60—far below the stated target.

Tesla’s Austin Robotaxi pilot, launched in June, uses supervised Model Y vehicles equipped with Hardware 4, not the driverless “Cybercab” shown in October. A Tesla employee remains in the vehicle to monitor operations. The service has struggled with long wait times and “High Service Demand” messages, not due to actual demand but because of the fleet’s very small size.

India’s manufacturing [PMI]( fell to 56.6 in November from 59.2 in October. According to the HSBC India Manufacturing [Purchasing Managers’ Index,]( the headline number stayed well above the neutral 50-mark and its long-term average of 54.2, indicating continued expansion. However, it marked the slowest improvement in operating conditions since February.

Manufacturers reported steady increases in output and new orders, but both categories expanded at the weakest pace in nine months. Companies cited tough market conditions, delays in project execution and increased competition among firms.

Export sales continued to grow but at a softer pace. New [export]( orders rose at the weakest rate in more than a year, even though firms reported favourable demand from clients in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Lower momentum in international markets added to the broader slowdown in sales and production.

The report also noted that job creation slipped to its lowest level since mid-2022.

tesla,Latest cheese recalls gets FDA’s most serious warning - TheStreet,https://www.thestreet.com/retail/latest-cheese-recalls-gets-fdas-most-serious-warning,"The cheese recall has an FDA Class I designation meaning consuming the product could cause illness or death.

* A nationwide cheese recall was issued due to listeria contamination risk.

* No illnesses were reported; the company suspended production and urges discarding or returning affected products.

* Food recalls surge; a 200% increase in Q3 2025 is attributed to improved monitoring and stricter regulations.

Food recalls are increasingly frequent as manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers work to remove contaminated products from shelves before they reach consumers. From dairy and deli meats to ready-to-eat meals and baked goods, recent recalls show how even trusted brands can face sudden safety risks.

The latest recall involves Italian cheese importer Ambriola Company, whose products are distributed under several major labels.

The company is withdrawing specific Pecorino Romano cheese products nationwide following concerns about possible listeria contamination, according to an [FDA announcement](

This recall is classified as **Class I**, the FDA’s most serious warning level, signaling a potential risk of severe illness or death if the cheese is consumed.

The recall began after routine testing by Ambriola Company detected listeria, a bacterium that can cause serious illness, especially in older adults, pregnant people, newborns, and those with weakened immune systems.

No illnesses have been reported so far.

“We take food safety very seriously and immediately alerted stores and distributors to remove the affected products from shelves,” Ambriola Company Chief Executive Officer Phil Marfuggi said in the [FDA announcement](

“We are working closely with the FDA and continuing to test our products and facilities to fully understand the situation.”

A newcomer to the baby formula market is facing a product recall due to possible contamination.

[Ambriola Company said]( it has temporarily suspended production and distribution of the affected cheeses while conducting a full review of sanitation and food safety procedures.

Boar’s Head is one of the companies that distributed the affected cheese, and this recall adds to a string of Boar’s Head-related concerns. In 2024, nine people died and at least 57 were hospitalized after eating contaminated Boar’s Head deli meats, according to a [CDC alert](

Boar’s Head said in a statement to [USA Today]( that it is “committed to delivering safe, high-quality foods that consumers can enjoy with confidence.”

* Do **not** eat recalled products, even if they look or smell normal.

* Discard them or return them to the retailer for a refund.

* Seek medical care if you consumed the products and experience symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, digestive issues, or neurological concerns.

The Ambriola Company recall highlights ongoing challenges in food production and supply chains. Even well-known brands can see major disruptions when a supplier’s process fails.

“There has been a 200% surge in recalls in Q3 2025, including increased recalls in every sector (auto, consumer products, medical devices, pharmaceutical, and food & beverage),” SVP of Client Services at Sedgwick Chris Harvey told TheStreet. Sedgwick, which provides companies with best practices for product recall and remediation solutions, just published its [U.S. Product Safety and Recall Index](

Nearly 1,000,000 bottles have been recalled.

While it may seem like food recalls are increasing, experts say enhanced monitoring, faster reporting systems, and better testing technology are the real drivers.

As regulatory scrutiny continues to be stricter amid heightened oversight and increased product movement during the holiday season, there is the potential for 2025 to see higher recall totals than last year, as well, Harvey said.

**Illnesses:** Multiple, including hospitalizations.

It's common as we age. Here's what to do.

You probably know that certain senses, like hearing and vision, become less acute with age. But you might not realize that taste is another one. In a 2025 study published in The International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, researchers gave taste tests to 1,392 healthy people ages 10 to 94, and found that the [ability to perceive flavors started diminishing in people in their 30s]( and dropped sharply after age 60.

The reasons are complex. Much of what we describe as taste is actually smell, and “the nerves that conduct the sense of smell tend to shrink as we age,” says Nicholas Rowan, MD, an associate professor of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. In addition, the number and sensitivity of the taste buds decline, along with the efficiency of the salivary glands and blood flow to the tongue, which also help us savor food.

But just because a lessening of taste and smell is normal doesn’t mean you should ignore it. “If you can’t taste well, that can lead to depression and other emotional issues,” says Peter G. Michaelson, MD, a clinical assistant professor of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Stony Brook Medicine in New York. It’s also associated with frailty and [nutritional deficiencies](

Fortunately, a complete loss of taste and smell is rare, and the strategies below can help sharpen those senses.

“The first six weeks of a decreased sense of smell or taste are critical for diagnosis and treatment,” Michaelson says, so it’s important to see an otolaryngologist, or ENT (which stands for ear, nose, and throat) doctor, as soon as possible.

[Nasal conditions]( such as polyps, sinusitis, allergies, and inflammation are common causes, and there are several treatments, such as steroids or in-office surgery. The loss of smell and taste may also be caused by a head injury, chemotherapy and radiation, hypothyroidism, and viruses such as the common cold and COVID-19. A 2024 study in JAMA Network Open found that among people who had COVID-19, nearly a third [still experienced residual smell loss a year later](

Be sure to go over all of your prescriptions with your doctor. Up to half of the top 100 most prescribed [drugs affect taste or smell negatively]( according to a 2018 report published in the World Journal of Otorhinolaryngology. They include statins and some blood pressure meds, antibiotics, antidepressants, and sleep drugs. Plus, a new study in the journal Physiology & Behavior suggests that [GLP-1 agonists (such as Ozempic and Wegovy) significantly reduce the sense of taste]( but not smell.

Your doctor may recommend olfactory training to help with a loss of smell. That’s when you regularly sniff a series of scents twice a day for a period of time. In a study in the journal Rhinology, 71 percent of people who did such training for a year [regained at least some of their sense of smell](

****Bump up seasonings.**** Those that pack a punch, like ginger, onions, garlic, and chili, are especially helpful. (Don’t use [more salt]( because too much sodium may raise blood pressure.)

****Avoid dry mouth.**** Saliva helps carry flavors throughout the mouth. So stay [hydrated]( and try adding something tart to your meals, such as lemon, to stimulate saliva production.

****Chew thoroughly.**** This gives the flavor compounds more time to travel from the mouth to the nasal cavity.

****Keep meals simple.**** Michaelson suggests avoiding combo platters or casseroles, which can make it more difficult to isolate flavors.

****Mix textures.**** This plays a role in taste perception. For instance, try apples slices, celery, or crackers with peanut or almond butter for a combo of crunchy and creamy.

Unregulated e-bikes are a growing danger on American streets. In one Bay Area town, a terrible accident finally led to reform.

David Darlington is a lifelong cyclist who has received a National Magazine Award for public interest for a previous article on traffic laws and bike safety.

In September 2023,Amelia Stafford was 15 and beginning her sophomore year at Terra Linda High School in eastern Marin County, Calif. An honor student who loved reading, played the trumpet, did well at science and aspired to work for NASA, Amelia often rode her bike to school. Both of her parents — Monica, who works for the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, and Scot, an Emmy-winning composer and a founder of the Pollen Music Group — have histories as cyclists: He grew up riding to school in San Francisco, and she commuted to her job on her bicycle across the Golden Gate Bridge. “It was very important to me that my kids grow up learning how to ride bikes,” Scot says.

“I wanted them to get exercise,” Monica adds, so Amelia’s bike didn’t have a motor. In the wake of the pandemic, electric bicycles were proliferating. Many of Amelia’s classmates had gotten e-bikes — or faster machines now known as e-motos — for birthdays and holidays. On a warm Saturday night after a football game, a group of kids was playing around with one.

Coral Billisi, Amelia’s best friend, recalls that Amelia got on the bike behind someone and rode up and down the street. She says it was such a short ride that wearing a helmet didn’t occur to anyone. When the bike toppled over, “our immediate reaction was that we all started laughing — we just thought it was so funny,” she says. “Like, Ha ha, they’re so stupid, they can’t even ride bikes.”

Then they saw the blood on the pavement around Amelia’s head.

Coral, who had taken a CPR course, called 911 and told the others not to touch Amelia. Then she ran to the Staffords’ house and banged on the door.

Monica had gone to bed early. She ran barefoot from the house. When she reached her daughter, Amelia’s eyes were open, but they had rolled back and blood was coming out of her ears. E.M.T.s arrived soon after and transported her to MarinHealth Medical Center, where a CT scan showed bleeding between the skull and the brain.

tesla,UK Autumn Budget: EV mileage tax prompts fleet cost concerns - Motor Finance Online,https://www.motorfinanceonline.com/news/uk-autumn-budget-ev-mileage-tax-prompts-fleet-cost-concerns/,"Industry figures call for urgent consultation on road pricing system and support for operators facing rising costs during the transition to zero-emission transport

Fleet operators reacted cautiously to the Autumn Budget, which confirmed substantial reforms to motoring taxation alongside measures intended to stabilise public revenues. The new electric vehicle mileage charge, due from April 2028, was a focal point for organisations managing large car and van fleets.

The policy will see battery-electric vehicles taxed at 3p per mile and plug-in hybrids at 1.5p per mile.

The gold standard of business intelligence.

Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.

Paul Hollick, Chair of the Association of Fleet Professionals ([AFP]( said fleets must now shape how the scheme is implemented. He warned that the charge “shouldn’t arrive in a form that could hamper electrification or cause any hesitation among potential business and private EV buyers,” adding that the AFP will play a central role in sector consultation.

From a remarketing standpoint, Philip Nothard, Chair of the [Vehicle Remarketing Association]( said the arrival of road pricing is “no surprise,” but emphasised the need to ensure it does not damage consumer perception of EVs. Nothard said simplicity and clarity will be critical to maintaining demand for both new and used electric models.

A number of operators expressed stronger concerns. Paul Holland, Managing Director for UK/ANZ Fleet at [Corpay]( said the new charge is “completely the wrong move at the wrong moment,” adding that businesses are being asked to “absorb even more pressure” while support for commercial EV adoption remains limited.

David Bushnell, Director of Consultancy and Strategy at [Fleet Operations]( described the Budget as offering “little meaningful support for the electrification of transport,” warning that higher lifetime EV costs could reduce sales by hundreds of thousands and “destabilise used values.”

# US Tariffs are shifting - will you react or anticipate?

Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.

Alongside eVED, the reversal of the fuel duty freeze triggered further disquiet. Fuel duty will rise in stages from late 2026 before moving to RPI indexation.

Simon Williams, Head of Policy at the RAC, said drivers will welcome the temporary continuance of the 5p cut, but that the relief will be “very short-lived” given the scheduled increases.

There were, however, positive reactions to several announcements.

John Peters, Head of Consultancy at [Arval UK,]( said the £1.3 billion extension of the Electric Car Grant will “support business-need vehicles and salary sacrifice schemes,” helping offset any decline in EV demand caused by road pricing. Peters also welcomed the uplift in the Expensive Car Supplement threshold, saying it makes “many popular electric cars more accessible for fleets.”

Suzanne (Sue) Robinson, Chief Executive of the [National Franchised Dealers Association]( similarly endorsed the ECS rise and said the grant extension could generate “an extra 130,000 electric car sales,” though she warned that pay-per-mile taxation “risks undermining consumer confidence at a critical moment.”

Delays to Employee Car Ownership Scheme (ECOS) reforms until 2030 were also widely welcomed. James Tew, CEO at [iVendi]( said the postponement avoids immediate disruption to dealer recruitment and nearly-new stock supply.

bitcoin,Crypto's Most Trusted Stablecoin Given Lowest Possible ‘Weak’ Rating By Major TradFi Agency - Gizmodo,https://gizmodo.com/tether-usdt-sandp-downgrade-2000693464,"Trust the dusty old rating agency with the spotty history, or trust the brash young crypto company?

Tether’s USDT, the dominant dollar-pegged stablecoin with nearly $185 billion in circulation, just took a hit from traditional finance rating powerhouse S&P Global, as it [downgraded]( its assessment of USDT’s ability to maintain its peg from 4 to 5, which is the weakest score on its associated scale.

S&P originally rolled out its stablecoin rating framework in 2023 to gauge risks like liquidity, governance, and asset backing in the emerging sector. According to their recent report on USDT, Tether’s reserves have shifted toward more volatile holdings over the past year. These perceived riskier assets, such as bitcoin, gold, secured loans, and corporate bonds, now make up 24% of the reserve mix, up from 17% in 2024.

One of S&P’s sharpest criticisms in its downgrade of USDT lies in its growing reliance on bitcoin in particular as a reserve asset, now comprising 5.6% of the backing, which is well above the 3.9% reserve buffer Tether itself flagged in its latest quarterly report ([PDF]( According to S&P, this exposure amplifies risks tied to bitcoin’s notorious volatility.

S&P also sees serious issues regarding transparency at Tether, as the stablecoin issuer’s attestations offer little more than high-level snapshots, with zero granularity on who holds these assets, how they’re custodied, or what counterparties lurk in the shadows.

That said, Tether’s reserves still lean heavily on short-term U.S. Treasuries and cash equivalents, accounting for 75% of the reserves. Despite the alleged red flags from S&P, USDT has held its $1 peg through many of crypto’s wild rides over the years, notably handling billions in redemptions without a hitch during the [collapse of crypto exchange FTX](

A Tether spokesperson told *Reuters* the company “strongly disagrees” with S&P’s assessment, which uses an outdated model that ignores USDT’s track record and role as vital infrastructure in emerging markets.

[Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino went further on X]( framing the downgrade as a badge of honor: Tether “wears S&P’s loathing with pride,” thriving as an “overcapitalized” outsider to a flawed legacy system. “The classical rating models built for legacy financial institutions, historically led private and institutional investors to invest their wealth into companies that despite being attributed investment grade ratings collapsed,” Ardoino added.

[In another post]( Ardoino pointed to Tether’s latest attestation [announcement]( where the company also claimed an excess reserve buffer approaching $30 billion; however, this is not explicitly part of USDT’s current reserves.

# Trust S&P or Trust Bitcoin?

In another post, Ardoino referenced S&P’s failures during the 2008 financial crisis, which were portrayed by a blind woman in the associated film The Big Short. [S&P paid a $1.375 billion settlement]( in a related case with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding allegations that the ratings agency had defrauded investors with its ratings of financial products in the lead up to the housing crisis. Notably, Bitcoin itself was originally launched in January 2009, almost as a direct response to the collapse of trust involved in the financial crisis.

Just weeks before scrutinizing Tether, [S&P also slapped a speculative ‘B-‘ issuer credit rating on bitcoin treasury company Strategy]( highlighting the firm’s $80 billion-plus bitcoin hoard as a vulnerability that could cripple debt payments amid market plunges. The agency’s outlook stays stable for now, but it flags Strategy’s negative cash flow and bitcoin concentration as red flags, much like the volatility risks baked into USDT’s reserves.

While S&P sees issues with Tether and Strategy using bitcoin as a reserve asset, many other well-known institutions, such as [the Harvard University Endowment]( and [the state of Texas]( are buying the crypto asset to hold for the long term and find it to be useful as an apolitical, digital store of value.

It should also be noted that S&P is largely focused on stablecoin issuers’ ability to redeem tokens for dollars in their assessments, so an asset like USDT where the issuer is operating more like a bank issuing its own private currency doesn’t necessarily fit the mold perfectly. In other words, USDT may be viewed negatively by many in the traditional financial system because it is operating on a new standard built on bitcoin rather than the traditional, dollar-based system.

# Where will leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin be in 5 years?

## Bitcoin's price has shot up more than five-fold since late 2020.

Bitcoin has been taking a breather for the past several weeks, but don't let that take attention away from its long-term performance. In the past five years, the leading cryptocurrency has soared 409% (as of Nov. 26).

Investors might be inclined to take a chance on Bitcoin on the recent dip. But where will this digital asset be in 2030?

Bitcoin has had a monster rise over the past decade. However, investors shouldn't extrapolate those gains going forward. The reasonable outlook is to expect lower returns, since the asset is maturing.

That being said, it wouldn't be surprising to see Bitcoin's price triple by the end of 2030. To do this, it would need togenerate a robust[compound annual rate of return]( of 25%. This would surely outperform the stock market by a wide margin.

Bitcoin's best trait is that it has a hard supply cap of 21 million units. This scarcity makes it a compelling asset to own, particularly as fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, constantly lose[purchasing power]( over time.

The current regulatory backdrop works to Bitcoin's benefit as well, making it easier for companies to build related products and services and for investors to access the crypto.

Bitcoin currently trades at around $88,000. In five years, it's not out of reach for it to trade around the $270,000 mark, if the bull run continues. As always, keep your risk tolerance in mind.

Dec 1, 2025, 4:50 a.m.

* BTC's monthly MACD histogram has turned bearish, signaling a potential prolonged downturn for bitcoin as seen in past cycles.

* Ether faces a bearish death cross.

*This is a technical analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.*

A widely watched momentum indicator has flashed red, a warning that has signaled the start of prolonged bitcoin [BTC$86.294,04](/price/bitcoin) downturns in every major cycle since 2012.

That indicator is the monthly chart moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram. The indicator printed the first red bar below the zero line in November as prices fell by over 17%, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change.

In other words, the negative reading on the indicator means the bull run that began around $20,000 early in November has ended and bears have taken over.

Over the years, these so-called bearish crossovers of the monthly MACD histogram have not been kinder to bulls. For instance, after bitcoin corrected from approximately $70,000 to $50,000 in late 2021, the MACD indicator turned bearish in January 2022, signaling a continuation of the downtrend that ultimately saw prices fall below $20,000.

Similar patterns emerged following bearish MACD crossovers in both 2018 and 2014, with these signals preceding the deepening of bear markets.

While past performance does not guarantee future results, meaning the latest bearish MACD crossover may not necessarily trigger a downturn, the current market environment supports the bearish case.

Several macro risks, including Japan's fiscal strain, resilience of the dollar index and Treasury yields despite talks of Federal Reserve rate cuts, and recent outflows from spot ETFs, reinforce the negative signal.

The message is simple: Traders need to be vigilant for downside volatility. First support lies near $84,500, defined by the trendline linking 2023-2024 higher lows. A break would expose April's low of around $74,500, then the 2021 peak near $70,000.

Ether's outlook doesn't look rosier either, as it has confirmed a death cross, a bearish pattern marked by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crossing below the 200-day SMA. It's a sign of a short-term trend underperforming a long-term trajectory, with the potential to evolve into a full-blown bear market.

While the term death cross sounds ominous, [its track record](/markets/2023/08/31/ether-heads-for-death-cross) as a reliable standalone indicator in the ether market has been mixed.

# Bitcoin Price Forecast 2026: Will BTC Crash to $50k or Rocket Toward $300k?

As 2025 closes, Bitcoin is limping but far from broken. After hitting a record above **$126,000 in early October 2025**, BTC slid sharply in November, briefly dropping near **$80,000** before stabilising. [[1]](

By 30 November 2025, Bitcoin is trading just above **$91,000**, according to multiple market data providers and price analyses. [[2]](

Against that volatile backdrop, **Bitcoin price forecasts for 2026 are wildly split**. Serious models and analysts are now calling for anything from **$50,000** at the low end to **$300,000+** — with some aggregated forecasts stretching as high as **$500,000**.

This article pulls together the latest **2026 Bitcoin price predictions**, the macro and policy drivers behind them, and a few grounded scenarios to help you interpret the noise. It’s **informational only**, not financial advice.

Before digging into forecasts, it helps to understand the setup.

* **New all‑time high, then a harsh reset.** Research from YouHodler and other analysts places Bitcoin’s all‑time high around **$126,000–$126,200 in early October 2025**. [[3]](

* **A 30%+ November drawdown.** The Economic Times reports that BTC dropped roughly **31% in November**, falling from the October peak toward **$82,000** amid hawkish Federal Reserve rhetoric, rising yields and nearly **$2 billion in crypto liquidations**. [[4]](

* **ETF-driven but choppy demand.** BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has exploded to about **$70+ billion in assets**, helping push total BlackRock Bitcoin ETF allocations near **$100 billion** and making them the firm’s biggest revenue driver — but November also saw more than **$2.3 billion** in outflows as prices fell. [[5]](

* **Policy tailwinds in the US.** The Trump administration has leaned into Bitcoin: Standard Chartered notes that BTC first broke **$100,000** after his election, and the bank now projects aggressive upside as regulatory and accounting rules become friendlier. [[6]](

At the same time, **macro uncertainty is high**. In November, DL News highlighted that Bitcoin ETFs just had their worst month for outflows since February, while analysts fret about liquidity, AI-bubble risks in equities and a divided Federal Reserve. [[7]](

In short: Bitcoin enters the 2026 window **battle‑tested**, heavily owned by institutions and governments, but sensitive to interest rates, liquidity and risk appetite.

Traditional finance has finally embraced making explicit multi‑year Bitcoin calls — and they don’t agree with each other at all.

* **Pro‑crypto US policy** under President Trump, including a federal working group on digital assets and discussion of a national digital asset stockpile. [[9]](

* **ETFs unleashing pent‑up institutional demand**, with tens of billions flowing into spot products. [[10]](

* **Falling volatility**, making BTC more acceptable as an institutional portfolio allocation alongside gold.

### Bernstein / MarketWatch: Up to ~$200,000 on an “extended cycle”

* The **current bull run, which began in 2023, could stretch through 2026 and peak in 2027**.

* Bitcoin could climb toward **$200,000 within about a year**, helped by US pro‑crypto policies (including a proposed federal Bitcoin reserve) and sustained ETF adoption. [[11]](

This view effectively argues that the classic four‑year Bitcoin cycle may **“break” or lengthen** as policy and institutional flows matter more than simple halving math.

On the other side, Bloomberg’s senior commodity strategist **Mike McGlone** has become a high‑profile bear:

* He argues Bitcoin could **drop around 40%** from autumn levels and trade near **$50,000 in 2026** — roughly 60% below its $126k high. [[12]](

* In a widely cited LinkedIn post, he framed the dilemma as **“Bitcoin $50,000 or $150,000 in 2026?”** and said his **bias is toward $50,000**, especially if the S&P 500 suffers a rare third down year in this cycle. [[13]](

* **Gold outperforming** while crude oil and stocks wobble encourages investors to de‑risk away from volatile assets like BTC. [[14]](

* **ETF outflows and liquidity stress** could deepen, mirroring the 2018 post‑bubble crash.

JPMorgan hasn’t published a headline‑grabbing 2026 BTC price target, but its mining sector research gives clues:

* The bank recently **upgraded selected miners** such as Cipher Mining and CleanSpark, lifting their **December 2026**price targets on expectations that high‑performance computing and AI workloads will support miner economics even if BTC prices stay under pressure. [[15]](

* The Economic Times highlights their modelling as consistent with a **crypto “rebound” into 2026**, even after November’s sharp pullback. [[16]](

The takeaway: **Big banks are split** between extremely bullish trajectories (200k–300k) and more cautious or even bearish paths (~50k). None of them treat current levels near 90k as a comfortable equilibrium.

Crypto‑native platforms and research shops tend to produce **structured, year‑by‑year tables**. While they’re not independent investment advice, they help map out the current sentiment.

+ **2026 range: $100,000–$189,900** (updated November 2025).

+ They describe this as a “conservative” range and see a broader long‑term path toward **$300,000 by 2030** if adoption continues. [[17]](

+ FAQ section suggests Bitcoin could reach about **$173,672 by end‑2026**, assuming constructive long‑term trends. [[19]](

+ Based on inputs from Binance users, the 2026 BTC value is projected around **$96,290.96** — essentially a modest gain from today. [[20]](

+ Under a simple model assuming BTC appreciates **5% per year**, Kraken’s calculator produces a **2026 price of about $95,939.55** and around **$189,953 by 2040**. [[21]](

+ Kraken explicitly notes this isn’t a forecast but a math exercise based on user‑chosen growth rates.

+ A late‑September analysis collated public forecasts and found **2026 price targets ranging roughly from $60,000 to $500,000**, with a **median near $201,000** when outliers are included. [[22]](

+ A November 2025 feature asked ChatGPT to summarise existing 2026 BTC models. The article reports that published projections span from roughly **$99,000 on the low end** (InvestingHaven’s minimum) to about **$228,000** (an optimistic model dubbed Orange Standard), with several mid‑range forecasts around **$120,000–$165,000**. [[23]](

> **Most crypto‑oriented forecasts cluster around a six‑figure BTC price in 2026**, typically between **$100,000 and $200,000**, assuming the current cycle doesn’t completely break down.

At the same time, tools from Binance and Kraken show that **small changes in assumed growth rates** dramatically shift these numbers — a reminder that many “forecasts” are really **parameter‑driven scenarios**, not crystal balls.

Numbers aside, 2026 Bitcoin forecasts hinge on a few powerful themes.

* BlackRock’s **IBIT** and its Brazil‑listed cousin have reached **around $100 billion in combined allocations** and now generate more revenue for the firm than long‑standing legacy ETFs. [[24]](

* IBIT alone holds roughly **3.9% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply**, according to ZyCrypto’s reporting, underscoring how much of BTC’s float is now locked inside regulated vehicles. [[25]](

* Continued **net inflows** into spot ETFs.

* More jurisdictions (and potentially new products like leveraged, options‑based or yield ETFs) widening access.

* Liquidity draining from risk assets if central banks stay tighter for longer.

### 4.2 Halving cycles vs. “breaking the cycle”

Bitcoin’s **fourth halving** in 2024 cut new supply again, and historically, BTC has peaked **12–18 months after** a halving. Classic cycle models would therefore expect a major top sometime in **late 2025 or early 2026**.

* Bernstein’s research (via MarketWatch) suggests the current bull run could **extend into 2026 and even 2027**, driven by policy and ETF demand, not just halving math. [[27]](

* A Forbes contributor (in a paywalled piece) framed **2026 as a year of “breaking cycles”**, arguing that Bitcoin and stablecoins are increasingly tied to institutional behaviour, cross‑border payments and state‑level adoption rather than retail mania alone. [[28]](

If they’re right, **2026 could be more like the middle of a super‑cycle** than the tail end of the usual four‑year pattern.

* Standard Chartered ties its aggressive BTC projections directly to **Trump‑era pro‑crypto moves**, including looser accounting rules and a friendlier regulatory framework. [[29]](

* A separate DL News report describes the **“Bitcoin for America Act”**, a bill from Representative Warren Davidson that would allow Americans to **pay federal income taxes in Bitcoin**, with the proceeds flowing into a **Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** now estimated around **$16 billion**. [[30]](

> The idea that **nation‑states will compete to accumulate Bitcoin** is moving from Twitter meme to serious policy discussion — and that’s explicitly built into some of the higher 2026 forecasts.

Even the best Bitcoin models crumble if the macro backdrop swings hard. Analysts watching 2026 point to several key variables:

+ DL News notes that some Russian market experts see **no full Bitcoin recovery before spring 2026** if the Fed doesn’t ease policy. [[31]](

+ Futures markets currently price a high probability of cuts in 2026 — but policymakers are openly divided on timing and magnitude. [[32]](

+ CryptoNews reports on concerns from **Robert Kiyosaki** and others about a “global liquidity reset” driven by Japan’s changing fiscal stance and the unwinding of leveraged yen carry trades, which could temporarily hurt risk assets including BTC. [[33]](

+ DL News links recent crypto drawdowns to equity volatility as investors question whether massive AI capex will pay off, pulling capital from high‑beta assets like Bitcoin. [[34]](

* **2020–2021:** Aggressive easing, booming liquidity and tech optimism → most 200k–300k Bitcoin scenarios look more plausible.

* **2018 or 2022:** Sticky inflation, balance‑sheet tightening and risk‑off sentiment → the more pessimistic 50k–80k paths come into play.

Forecasts are really just **different assumptions about that macro dice roll**.

Pulling all this together, you can group the current 2026 Bitcoin forecasts into three broad bands. These are not my predictions, just a way to organise what the market is saying.

* Warnings about **ETF outflows**, liquidity drains and AI‑bubble fallout from multiple market commentators. [[36]](

* **No sustained Fed easing**; rates stay high or cut only modestly.

* ETFs flip from net buyers to **persistent net sellers**.

* Bitcoin behaves more like a **high‑beta tech stock**, underperforming gold and sovereign bonds.

* The 2024–26 cycle rhymes with **2017–2018**, with a long, grinding comedown from the 2025 peak.

In this scenario, Bitcoin is still far above its 2022 lows, but many of the six‑figure forecasts prove **too optimistic, too soon**.

* Nasdaq / GOBankingRates’ summary of models between roughly **$99k and $228k**, with several mid‑range projections. [[40]](

* **Macro softens gradually**: rates drift lower, but no huge money‑printing spree.

* Spot ETFs keep a **net‑positive but choppy** flow profile, with periods of outflows offset by renewed interest. [[41]](

* Bitcoin carves out a broad **six‑figure trading range**, with periodic spikes above 150k and sharp pullbacks, but no structural breakdown below prior cycle highs for long.

* The 2024 halving still matters, but the peak doesn’t arrive in a clean 12–18 month window — price action is choppier and more drawn‑out.

For long‑term holders, this scenario still represents **solid real returns**, but the path is noisy enough that **leverage and over‑sizing can be dangerous**.

* Bernstein’s extended‑cycle view, with a potential move toward **$200,000** as ETFs and a federal Bitcoin reserve reshape demand. [[43]](

* YouHodler and other bullish long‑term models that see **$170k+** in the second half of the decade, with upside to **$250k–$700k by 2030** in optimistic scenarios. [[44]](

* CryptoSlate’s compilation of public forecasts that stretches the **2026 high‑end up to about $500,000** in extreme cases. [[45]](

* **Aggressive global ETF and institutional adoption**; pension funds, insurers and sovereign wealth funds make Bitcoin a standard allocation. [[46]](

* The **US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** concept gains traction; paying taxes in BTC and similar policies encourage governments to accumulate rather than sell. [[47]](

* Gold stagnates or loses mindshare as “digital gold” becomes a mainstream thesis.

* Halving plus policy plus macro relief create **compounding tailwinds**, driving a parabolic leg that pushes BTC well beyond 150k – potentially into the Standard Chartered 300k zone.

This outcome is **not impossible** — but it requires **multiple favourable forces to line up at once**, with surprisingly few policy or macro shocks along the way.

If you’re reading Bitcoin price predictions for 2026, you’re probably thinking about **positioning**. A few practical ways to treat these forecasts as tools, not gospel:

Notice how serious forecasters mostly give **bands** (e.g. $100k–$190k), not precise ticks. Treat any 2026 number as a **zone of possibility**, not a promise.

A model saying “BTC could be 150k in 2026” doesn’t tell you whether it visits **50k first**. Many 2026 outlooks, including Kiyosaki’s and McGlone’s, explicitly warn about **sharp interim drawdowns** even in bullish long‑term scenarios. [[48]](

The biggest disagreements in 2026 forecasts aren’t really about Bitcoin’s code or halving schedule — they’re about **interest rates, liquidity and regulation**. Make sure your own plan makes sense in **both** a dovish and a hawkish world.

Some of the highest numbers come from venues that also promote presales, meme coins or high‑yield products in the same breath. Use those forecasts as **sentiment signals**, not as investment blueprints. [[49]](

If you’re a short‑term trader, the difference between 120k and 200k in 2026 matters far less than **next month’s volatility**. If you’re a long‑term allocator, you may care more about whether Bitcoin credibly reaches **multi‑hundred‑thousand levels by 2030** than whether it finishes 2026 at 110k or 150k. [[50]](

All of the forecasts above — from banks, crypto platforms, AI models and columnists — can be wrong. Bitcoin remains **highly volatile and speculative**. You should only invest money you can afford to lose and consider getting advice from a qualified financial professional before making major decisions.

## 8. Bottom Line: What Does a “Realistic” Bitcoin 2026 Forecast Look Like?

* **Floor risk:** Serious analysts see a non‑trivial chance that Bitcoin could revisit **$50,000–$80,000** in a harsh risk‑off environment. [[51]](

* **Central tendency:** Many structured models and consensus tools cluster around a **six‑figure BTC in 2026**, often in the **$100k–$150k** neighbourhood. [[52]](

* **Upside tail:** A smaller but vocal group of banks and analysts think policy, ETFs and state‑level accumulation could push Bitcoin toward **$200k–$300k** by 2026, with extreme outliers talking about **half a million**. [[53]](

No one *knows* which path will win. What we can say is that **2026 is shaping up to be one of the most consequential years in Bitcoin’s short history** — a year where halving‑cycle tradition collides with ETF‑driven institutionalisation and rapidly shifting global monetary policy.

If you decide to be part of that story, make sure your plan is built for **both** the 50k winter **and** the 300k summer.

Some of the most bullish bitcoin and crypto speculators have said they expect a December Federal Reserve bombshell to power a bitcoin price boom...

bitcoin,SEC’s Hester Peirce Defends Self-Custody as Bitcoin Holders Shift to ETFs - Cointribune,https://www.cointribune.com/en/sec-leaders-back-crypto-self-custody-as-etf-adoption-reshapes-bitcoin-ownership/,"19h30 ▪ 4 min read ▪ by James G.

Self-custody and financial privacy have returned to the forefront of the U.S. crypto conversation after SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce reaffirmed them as core individual rights. Her remarks come amid regulatory uncertainty, rising ETF adoption, and renewed debate over Bitcoin’s founding principles.

* SEC officials call self-custody a fundamental right, while Congress delays the key crypto market structure bill to 2026.

* Bitcoin holders shift to ETFs, driven by tax-friendly in-kind creations and simpler asset management choices.

* Rising ETF adoption sparks debate as critics say moving away from self-custody weakens Bitcoin’s original purpose.

* PlanB’s move to ETFs adds fuel to community concerns over growing reliance on third-party custodial services.

Peirce, who also leads the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, said on The Rollup podcast that holding one’s own assets should never be questioned in a nation built on personal freedom. According to her, [self-custody]( is a basic human right, and she expressed disbelief that Americans would be expected to rely on intermediaries to safeguard their assets.

She also stated that privacy should be standard in online financial activity rather than treated as a suspicious choice.

Her comments come as the Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity Act faces further delays. Senator Tim Scott confirmed that the bill, which addresses self-custody, AML rules, and asset taxonomy, has been pushed to 2026. Scott added that the broader effort aims to [empower everyday Americans]( in the growing digital economy. He also noted that lawmakers plan to present a bipartisan draft soon in hopes of delivering it to President Trump.

During a June roundtable of the SEC Crypto Task Force, Commissioner Paul Atkins [voiced a similar position]( calling self-custody a core American value. His remarks reinforced Peirce’s stance at a time when industry behavior is shifting.

Rising interest in crypto investment vehicles is changing how long-term Bitcoin holders manage their coins. Many whales and early adopters are now moving assets into [exchange-traded funds]( motivated by tax advantages and simpler administration. Dr. Martin Hiesboeck of Uphold reported the first notable decline in self-custodied Bitcoin in 15 years.

* Approval of in-kind ETF creations that avoid taxable events.

* Preference for simpler asset management.

* Growing comfort with regulated investment structures.

* Reduced willingness to maintain private key security.

* Influence of high-profile investors choosing ETFs.

In July, the SEC allowed in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto ETFs, enabling holders to exchange Bitcoin for ETF shares without triggering tax obligations tied to cash-settled products. Hiesboeck warned that this development moves the industry away from the long-standing “not your keys, not your coins” principle.

[Sentiment in the Bitcoin community]( intensified after PlanB, creator of the stock-to-flow model, revealed in February that he transferred his Bitcoin into ETFs to avoid the burden of managing private keys. His decision sparked strong reactions, with many arguing that surrendering custody contradicts Bitcoin’s purpose as a self-sovereign asset.

bitcoin,Asia Morning Briefing: BOJ Rate-Hike Bets Trigger Asia Selloff and Bitcoin Slide - CoinDesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/01/asia-morning-briefing-boj-rate-hike-bets-trigger-asia-selloff-and-bitcoin-slide,"## Short-term Japanese yields reached their highest level since 2008, strengthening the yen and pressuring leveraged crypto positions during Hong Kong trading hours.

Updated Dec 1, 2025, 2:34 a.m. Published Dec 1, 2025, 2:26 a.m.

* Bitcoin fell below $87,500 in Asia as Japanese bond yields hit a 17-year high, prompting risk-off selling.

* Japan's 2-year bond yield reached 1.01%, the highest since 2008, amid speculation of a potential rate hike by the Bank of Japan.

* Traders are closely watching the yen's movement and BOJ signals, with potential for further market volatility.

*Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see* [*CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.*](/daybook-us)

Bitcoin slid below $90,000 during Hong Kong's morning hours as Japanese bond yields surged to fresh 17-year highs, triggering a wave of risk-off selling across regional markets.

Japan’s 2-year government bond yield briefly touched 1.01 percent, the highest since 2008, as traders bet the Bank of Japan’s long era of near-zero rates is ending. The selloff followed comments by BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who said the board will evaluate whether a rate hike is appropriate at this month’s meeting.

Traders pushed up the yen in the morning session in Tokyo, which will eventually accelerate an unwind of yen-funded carry trades that have supported risk assets throughout the year.

Crypto markets, which are deeply sensitive to short-term liquidity conditions in Asia, bore the brunt of the move with BTC dropping below $87,500 and Ether following lower.

Prediction markets reflect uncertainty about Japan’s policy outlook, with [Polymarket traders]( now pricing the chances of a December rate increase at roughly 50%, up seven percentage points.

This week's focus for traders will be on how the yen moves and what the BOJ is communicating. Any further tightening signals could trigger another round of volatility across regional markets and crypto.

**BTC:** Bitcoin’s slide below $87,500 set off a wave of forced selling, with more than $150 million in BTC longs liquidated as rising Japanese yields pushed traders to unwind leveraged positions.

**ETH:** Ether fell toward $2,850, with about $140 million in long positions liquidated as Japan’s shifting rate outlook tightened liquidity across the early Asia session.

**Gold:** Goldman Sachs says nearly 70% of institutional investors expect gold to keep rising, with the largest group forecasting prices above $5,000 by 2026.

**Nikkei 225:** Asia-Pacific markets slipped Monday as traders awaited China’s manufacturing data and priced in an 87% chance of a Fed rate cut, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 1.3%.

* As of October 2025, GoPlus has generated $4.7M in total revenue across its product lines. The GoPlus App is the primary revenue driver, contributing $2.5M (approx. 53%), followed by the SafeToken Protocol at $1.7M.

* GoPlus Intelligence's Token Security API averaged 717 million monthly calls year-to-date in 2025 , with a peak of nearly 1 billion calls in February 2025. Total blockchain-level requests, including transaction simulations, averaged an additional 350 million per month.

* Since its January 2025 launch , the $GPS token has registered over $5B in total spot volume and $10B in derivatives volume in 2025. Monthly spot volume peaked in March 2025 at over $1.1B , while derivatives volume peaked the same month at over $4B.

Major cryptocurrencies traded lower in early Asia as DeFi platform Yearn noted at ""incident"" in its yETH pool.

* Major cryptocurrencies fell early Monday, continuing the November downtrend.

* The decline happened as an incident at DeFi platform Yearn Finance affected its yETH liquidity pool.

***On Jan. 29, Truther launches a USDT Visa card in El Salvador, which is non-custodial. Direct wallets incur a 2% conversion fee when making purchases. No preloading required.***

Truther will transform cryptos in Latin America. During the Blockchain conference in Brazil, the company declared its collaboration with Visa. The card will have a debut launch in El Salvador.

The product is aimed at travelers and crypto users who want useful solutions. Old-fashioned crypto cards either need to be preloaded or custodial. The innovation of Truther does away with these two requirements altogether.

**You might also like:** [BTC News: El Salvador Makes Largest-Ever Bitcoin Buy With 1,090 BTC Addition](

[CoinDesk]( states that the card deducts USDT at the point of purchase. In the case of the interview at the conference, founder Rocelo Lopes described the process. The users keep full control over their personal wallets.

You do not charge the card in advance, Lopes said. A 30 euros hotel bill will automatically convert to USDT. The exchange is real-time and has no delays.

The card currently uses Polygon blockchain infrastructure. Truther intends to migrate to the Liquid network, where privacy is better. Users do not convert crypto into fiat.

All conversions of currency attract a charge of 2%. Brazilian users are exempt from the IOF tax. All users can access the card after launching.

Truther already handles $40 million in daily volume of transactions. [USDT]( is linked to the PIX payment system in Brazil through the company. Stablecoin payouts to creators and workers were recently piloted by Visa.

The bitcoin legal tender status in El Salvador presents a perfect experimental environment. Its introduction is succeeded by expansion plans to other parts of Latin America. Other markets will be accessed gradually.

Swapix API by Truther supports real-time crypto-to-fiat transfers. The next in the queue is Argentina. Subsequent rollouts are to Mexico, Colombia, and Russia.

The choice of the market is based on the availability of a 24/7 payment infrastructure. The support of QR code transactions is vital to operations. [Market]( preparedness is determined by the real-time settlement capabilities.

The self-custody wallet accepts BTC and USDT at the moment. The Brazilian real-pegged stablecoin Truther is based on Liquid. There are more local integrations of stablecoins in early 2025.

Tether Gold will enter the wallet portfolio. A token pegged to Argentine pesos enters development phases. Users are able to use crypto through QR codes.

There are no network gas fees as recipients obtain stablecoins. The capability increases the ease of use in daily transactions. Conventional banks are considering stablecoin platform integration.

Lopes refused to provide any specific details of the bank partnerships. His anticipations are a tripling of stablecoin volumes in twelve months. Conventional financial institutions are fueling the expansion of the ecosystem.
