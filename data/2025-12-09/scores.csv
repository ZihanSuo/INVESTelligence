Texas has become the first state in the nation to allocate public funds to bitcoin following the implementation of Senate Bill 21, a law passed earlier this year that authorizes the creation of a state-managed digital asset reserve. In a post on X, Texas Blockchain Council President Lee Bratcher wrote that the state had made a $10 million bitcoin investment through a spot exchange-traded fund executed through the purchase of shares in the iShares Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded fund managed by BlackRock. The law permits the state to hold and manage bitcoin and other digital assets through a designated reserve, intended to diversify state holdings and serve as a strategic hedge. While the $10 million purchase is modest compared to the state’s broader financial portfolio, the move places Texas at the forefront of digital asset adoption among public entities.",,

[...] “The uncertainty with which bitcoin is hovering around the $90,000 mark reflects a prevailing fear that tomorrow’s FOMC meeting will be somewhat of an anticlimax,"" Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments.

“Though a rate cut is now expected by nearly 90% of market participants and largely priced in, it’s the forward guidance that matters, and investors appear to be betting on a ‘hawkish cut’ tomorrow.” [...] “For now, attention is on the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision on December 10, where a cut is largely expected. On its own, such a move may offer little upside to bitcoin’s price, as it’s likely already priced in,” Koinly chief executive Robin Singh said via email.

Blockchain is rewriting them. A Picasso, a penthouse, or a private loan used to be out of reach for most investors. Today, blockchain technology is slicing those assets into tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and opening the door to anyone with a few hundred dollars to invest.

## What Are Tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs)? [...] You start with a real-world asset, say, an apartment building or a piece of fine art. A token created on a blockchain, akin to a ""digital twin,"" represents ownership of that asset. Because these blockchain tokens are divisible, investors can buy small fractions, just like owning fractional shares of a stock. Much like a stock, tokenized RWAs offer investors the potential for growth and income. These assets can also be bought, traded, and sold between investors on blockchain platforms. [...] Tokenized RWAs stand out for several reasons. Investors can purchase these tokens in fractions for as little as a few hundred dollars. They get access to real estate, private credit, or even rare collectibles such as fine art or vintage cars. And unlike traditional real estate or private equity, investors can buy and sell tokenized assets on blockchain platforms, providing liquidity in historically illiquid markets.

Long said a price floor for nickel from Washington would be impractical given the large size of the market for that metal and pushed for limits on Indonesia’s output instead. Rare earths, though, are a much smaller market than nickel and price supports are key until there is more transparent pricing, said Sanderson, a former US diplomat and executive at copper miner Freeport-McMoRan.

In 2022 a cornerstone investor, U.K. private-equity firm Appian Capital Advisory, sold its 20% share in Peak to Shenghe Resources, a partly state-owned Chinese rare-earths juggernaut that has steadily bought up stakes in promising rare-earth deposits in Tanzania from Western companies that controlled them. Peak said it would formally scrap the planned joint venture with Shenghe, citing “recent geopolitical and regulatory developments.” A major problem, Davis said, were regulations Beijing had introduced in recent years restricting the export of Chinese rare-earth technology that would have made it difficult for the Australian and Chinese companies to work together.",,

In the letter to the mines minister dated December 5 and seen by Reuters, the Chamber of Mines said exporters face “serious difficulties” in applying quotas and have repeatedly sought, without success, a meeting with ARECOMS to clarify concerns over its role, the legality of mandatory prepayments, and new documentation requirements that have stalled shipments. China, which controls about 70–75% of global cobalt refining capacity and supplies major companies, including automakers Tesla and BYD and battery maker CATL, depends on Congo for feedstock, making any export delay a threat to EV and battery supply chains.

""The tariff cuts agreed under the U.S.-China trade truce didn't help to lift shipments to the U.S. last month, but overall export growth rebounded nonetheless,"" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. China has stepped up efforts to diversify its export markets since Trump won November 2024's U.S. election, pursuing closer trade ties with Southeast Asia and the European Union. October's unexpected downturn, following an 8.3% surge the month prior, signalled that Chinese exporters' tactic of front-loading U.S.-bound shipments to beat Trump's tariffs had run its course. Although Chinese factory owners reported an improvement in new export orders in November, they were still in contraction, underscoring continued uncertainty for manufacturers as they struggle to replace demand in the absence of U.S. buyers.",,

The proposal would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year, according to a White House official and several people familiar with the plan. Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.
