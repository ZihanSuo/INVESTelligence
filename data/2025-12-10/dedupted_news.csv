As bitcoin edged higher Tuesday, Standard Chartered said it now expects the cryptocurrency to end the year higher at $100,000. That’s still a halving of its previous year-end target of $200,000, which was issued in June 2024. [...] The bank also halved its bitcoin forecast for year-end 2026 to $150,000, from $300,000, and lowered its year-end projections through 2029. But it still expects bitcoin

can reach $500,000 in 2030, according to a Tuesday note by Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital-assets research at Standard Chartered.

Kendrick said the bank's view is now for bitcoin to end this year at around $100,000, implying 6% upside from the crypto's current levels.

For next year, he see bitcoin hitting $150,000, about half of the prior target of $300,000. [...] Standard Chartered slashed its price target for bitcoin over the next five years.

The bank, which once saw bitcoin hitting $200k this year, revised its targets amid the latest bear market.

It now predicts that bitcoin will hit $150k by the end of 2026, half of what it previously predicted.

One of Wall Street's biggest bitcoin cheerleaders has significantly dialed down his forecast for the crypto. [...] The price target changes were largely spurred by bitcoin's recent sell-off, Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in a note on Tuesday. The crypto is down around 27% from its peak in early October.

He said that bitcoin treasuries — firms that buy and hold bitcoin on their balance sheets — likely won't support the price of the cryptocurrency going forward. Instead, the token will have to rely primarily on ETF buying to move higher, he added.",1

According to a report by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, currently over 75% of bitcoin mining activities are concentrated in the United States. In Malaysia, as long as operators legally obtain electricity and pay taxes according to the law, bitcoin mining is considered legal.

The combined market cap of USDC and USDT alone now exceeds $250 billion, and the success of these tokens underscores a broader trend in crypto where asset issuers and fintechs build increasingly proprietary and centralized infrastructure and reject more decentralized base-layer protocols that have less relevance when so much centralization is found at other layers of the crypto technology stack anyway. The idea with Stable is to embrace this reality of stablecoin dominance in crypto by building a blockchain that is purpose-built for these centrally issued, dollar-pegged tokens from the ground up. Due to the longstanding reliance alternative crypto networks like Ethereum have had on stablecoins and other key points of centralization, it’s unclear what their value propositions will be if the likes of Tether, Circle, Coinbase, and other major, centralized players in the crypto space can push users over to their own proprietary platforms.",0

Remarkably, all the rare earths are being sourced from material on a waste dump in Phalaborwa, Limpopo, which is giving South Africa a significantly low-cost high-value lead-in to the commercial production of rare earths needed by the booming permanent magnet market. By and large, the two most economically important to us, and probably for any rare earth project at the moment, are neodymium and praseodymium, and we are endowed with a comparatively high fraction of that in our Phalaborwa ore, with neodymium and praseodymium making up close to 30% of our rare earths basket, which is significantly higher than most typical rare earths projects and mines, and which positions the company in a very good space to supply these critical rare earth elements.",5

China, which controls about 70–75% of global cobalt refining capacity and supplies major companies, including automakers Tesla and BYD and battery maker CATL, depends on Congo for feedstock, making any export delay a threat to EV and battery supply chains.

Tesla is trading at over 190x Forward Earnings. Traditional automakers such as Toyota or GM trade at 7x to 11x. Even major tech firms like Google trade at 28x. The “Tesla Premium” is wholly contingent on the market believing that Tesla’s software margins will eventually surpass its hardware margins. [...] The market currently finds itself caught between two conflicting identities for Tesla. One portrays it as an auto manufacturer rapidly advancing amid severe competition in China and a slow adoption of EVs in the U.S. The other presents Tesla as a progressive “Embodied AI” enterprise that tackles autonomy and humanoid robotics. The stock price has been tethered to the latter narrative, assuming perfection.

Morgan Stanley’s downgrade disrupts that tether. [...] Our Take

Tesla at $439 represents a battleground where the “Dream” is yielding to the “Math.” The Morgan Stanley downgrade is important not solely due to the alteration in rating, but more so due to who made the change. It indicates that even the staunchest supporters require tangible execution before pursuing higher stock prices.",0

""And that's not a reflection of a healthy market with lots of choice,"" Scaringe said. ""If you think of it as a consumer, you have 300 different internal combustion engine choices at that price or lower, and you have maybe one highly compelling EV choice."" [...] The US EV industry comprises Rivian, Tesla, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, BMW, and Kia, among others.

Brands like Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla dominate the EV market in Europe. Chinese brands like BYD, NIO, and MG also sell on the continent. [...] Meanwhile, the EV industry in China is seeing fierce competition. BYD, Tesla's biggest global rival, saw its sales fall 12% in October compared to the same period a year earlier, as it faces a tough fight from local EV startups Xpeng, Nio, and Leapmotor.

Other players, such as smartphone manufacturer-turned EV maker Xiaomi, are also seeing success in the country with strong sales.
