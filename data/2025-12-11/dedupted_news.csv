Bleeding-edge EV tech isn't entirely to blame, considering that Jeep ranked 32, just one point ahead of Tesla, with Ram at 35, Chrysler at 36, and Dodge at 39. We bash Tesla a lot, and for good reasons, but Futurism points out that Tesla jumped from 18th to ninth in CR's reliability rankings for new cars. To end on a positive note, after Lexus and Toyota's excellent performance, Mazda ranks 58, a distant 15 points behind Toyota, but still rather good. Honda and Acura round out the top five with 57 and 53 points, respectively, with Honda ranking slightly above its upscale sub-brand.",0

CEO Elon Musk has long promised mass-market vehicles, though last year he scrapped plans for an all-new $25,000 EV, opting instead to build lower-priced versions of existing models, a shift that has sparked concerns among analysts about cannibalising sales of higher-margin cars. A low-cost Model Y crossover was launched in October as Tesla seeks to defend its market share against European and Chinese rivals offering increasingly lower-priced electric cars in Europe, with many selling EVs below $30,000. The new Model 3 Standard is listed at 37,970 euros ($44,299.60) in Germany, 330,056 Norwegian crowns ($32,698) in Norway and 449,990 Swedish crowns ($47,820) in Sweden, according to Tesla's website.",0

However, for those who are not as sold on that path, or who at least care a lot about the traditional automaker sales story as well, there’s the question or discussion around how much Tesla can juice sales with model updates and new models. Some Tesla fans are super excited that Tesla Model Y sales are booming in China as a result. Looking at the first 10 months of the year, I found that Tesla Model Y plus Model 3 sales were down from ~500,000 sales in January–October 2024 to ~458,000 sales in January–October 2025. Yes, it’s a positive that Tesla sales are finally growing again year over year in China, but demand doesn’t seem to be booming in a historical context, and there’s no indication Tesla is returning to 2023 levels, let alone shooting past them.",0

But French investigation authority BEA says this surface had not been checked fully during maintenance – despite the skin debonding being sufficient to obstruct weather radar antenna movement three days before the Osaka-Paris flight. Further alerts indicated unreliable speed, multiple instances of air-data rejection by the primary computers, and loss of protection under alternate law. The crew responded by disengaging the autopilot, autothrust, and flight director, and proceed in manual flight – with one pilot using the head-up display while another checked display consistency with the aid of a pitch-thrust data table. This system – known as NAIADS, or New Air and Inertia Automatic Data Switching – kept the flight-envelope protection and automatic systems, including the autopilot, autothrust and flight director, available for the duration. NAIADS is designed to automatically supply optimum airspeed data to primary displays and the flight-control laws.",0

Despite Musk’s perpetual hype, FSD is still a driver-assistance system that does not make Tesla’s vehicles fully autonomous. Musk himself has in the past said that Autopilot, the driver assistance system that comes standard in all Teslas, sometimes made drivers too complacent and confident.

Today’s snippets from Autoblog add another negative data point: Tesla has reportedly **dropped a cheaper Model 3 variant in parts of Europe amid a “market share collapse,”** which could further weaken its price competitiveness if confirmed in more markets. **For Monday’s trading, this tension matters:** optimistic AI/robotaxi headlines tend to support Tesla’s high multiple, while any data showing **slowing EV demand, falling market share or FSD setbacks** can trigger sharp pullbacks. 2.
