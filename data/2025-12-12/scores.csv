Wall Street drains value from assets, it doesn’t inject money into markets – it farms them. That’s not to say it doesn’t have its place, but for an emerging asset like crypto or bitcoin, it acts as a predator in a naïve land. I don’t think that ends well for the asset.

However, let’s keep the words to a minimum and look at the chart: [...] The key point is that we don’t have to be a bull or a bear – we can just observe. A W-shaped structure is very bullish, but if the subsequent support level is broken, a sharp decline typically follows:

In my view, bitcoin is in a bear market, and only a miracle will save it. It can happen—but I believe it won’t.

The target in that scenario would be $140,000+. However, I’m not going to bother drawing that chart, because as I’ve stated, the crypto winter is here.",61.4,-0.75

The distinction lies in the collateral, instead of short term government securities, the reserve would be built on corporate credit instruments backed by bitcoin.

The law permits the state to hold and manage bitcoin and other digital assets through a designated reserve, intended to diversify state holdings and serve as a strategic hedge.

Tesla stock heads into Monday’s U.S. session sitting near all‑time highs but surrounded by conflicting headlines: a possible multibillion‑dollar legal hit tied to Elon Musk’s pay, a Cybertruck rollout that’s badly missing expectations, worsening European demand, and a 2026 bet on Full Self‑Driving (FSD) in Europe that could be either a massive catalyst or a regulatory mirage. Today’s snippets from Autoblog add another negative data point: Tesla has reportedly **dropped a cheaper Model 3 variant in parts of Europe amid a “market share collapse,”** which could further weaken its price competitiveness if confirmed in more markets. **For Monday’s trading, this tension matters:** optimistic AI/robotaxi headlines tend to support Tesla’s high multiple, while any data showing **slowing EV demand, falling market share or FSD setbacks** can trigger sharp pullbacks. 2.
