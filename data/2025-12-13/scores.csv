Canadian mineral exploration company Volta Metals has reported the latest rare earth drill results from its inaugural programme at the Springer rare earth deposit near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Moreover, the results show higher heavy rare earth element (HREE) intercepts over wide intervals, including significant grades of dysprosium and terbium oxides. Meanwhile, borehole SL25-23 was mineralised with total rare earth oxides (TREOs) throughout its entire hole, averaging 0.89% TREOs over 383.5m (from 44m to 427.5m, end of hole), including 1.71% TREOs over 69.5m. Volta Metals CEO Kerem Usenmez said: “These drill results validate our view that the Springer deposit represents a rare convergence of location, grade, scale and mineralogy – an increasingly scarce combination globally. “The expansion of high-grade TREOs at depth, together with a confirmed strong proportion of heavy rare earths, marks an important step forward as we move toward updating the mineral resource estimate in early 2026.",70.8,0.6
