""The tariff cuts agreed under the U.S.-China trade truce didn't help to lift shipments to the U.S. last month, but overall export growth rebounded nonetheless,"" said Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics. China has stepped up efforts to diversify its export markets since Trump won November 2024's U.S. election, pursuing closer trade ties with Southeast Asia and the European Union. October's unexpected downturn, following an 8.3% surge the month prior, signalled that Chinese exporters' tactic of front-loading U.S.-bound shipments to beat Trump's tariffs had run its course. Although Chinese factory owners reported an improvement in new export orders in November, they were still in contraction, underscoring continued uncertainty for manufacturers as they struggle to replace demand in the absence of U.S. buyers.",0

""Google has the money and they're not going to wait,"" Gerber said. ""They know they can scale, so for Tesla to catch them, they would need this to work right away, basically, and then they need to start building infrastructure."" [...] In that time, Tesla's chief competitor, Waymo, has continued to dominate the self-driving car market. Gerber attributes this to Musk's refusal to use LidAR technology in Tesla's vehicles, a remote sensing method that has helped Waymo increase the safety of its cars on the road.

""Waymo has expanded rapidly in our area,"" he said. ""So Tesla has to accept, if they just throw a couple sensors on and improve their hardware system, they can solve full self-driving next month.""
