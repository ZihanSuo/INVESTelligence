Carina is estimated to contain probable reserves of 165.4 million tonnes with 1,723 parts per million (ppm) total rare earth oxides, including 336ppm neodymium-praseodymium, 47ppm dysprosium and 7.5ppm terbium. Carina Project is planned to be operated as a conventional open‑pit mine using a standard load‑and‑haul fleet across all rock types. Power for the Carina project will be supplied via a dedicated high‑voltage transmission line operating at 230kV.
