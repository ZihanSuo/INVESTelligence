From Elon Musk — the guy who brought the world a branded flamethrower — it somehow tracks that Tesla is now making pickleball paddles. The EV company launched its latest lifestyle product on Friday: a $350 pickleball paddle created in partnership with Selkirk, a sports equipment company. A Selkirk spokesperson told Business Insider that the paddle's creation was first conceptualized after a conversation at the 2023 USA Pickleball National Championships between Barnes and members of Tesla's engineering team. The limited-run batch of the paddle sold out on Tesla's website in under three hours after its launch, a Selkirk spokesperson told Business Insider. While the pickleball paddle is Tesla's first foray into traditional, non-electrified sports equipment, the automaker does offer a line of apparel and home products, like drinkware ($30+), backpacks ($185+), and salt and pepper shakers ($65).",45.28,0.15

Tesla's Austin robotaxi fleet currently consists of only about 25-30 vehicles. Beyond robotaxis, Tesla is eyeing the $900+ billion U.S. trucking industry with its Semi truck, which is expected to begin volume production in 2026. Tesla's empty cars driving through Austin represent either the beginning of a transportation revolution or an expensive science experiment that's years behind better-funded competitors. If you're buying Tesla today, you're not betting on car sales - you're betting that the company can turn its fleet of vehicles into a platform for AI-powered services that generate recurring revenue for decades. Watch for three things in 2026: whether Tesla can scale its Austin robotaxi fleet from dozens to thousands of vehicles, whether the Semi truck enters volume production as promised, and whether Full Self-Driving subscriptions become a meaningful revenue stream.",71.4,0.3
