What emerged from that reset was not just a company, but an infrastructure for the future of sport. Blockchain Sports built two football academies in Brazil with IoT-based training systems, launched Atleta Network, its proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, and developed AI tools to evaluate athletic performance in real time. In February 2024, Blockchain Sports made its global debut at Dubai's Coca-Cola Arena. For Saksonov, the moment carried personal weight.

According to the text, transitioning to MDR and IVDR from the previous regulatory framework has ""led to the discontinuation of certain devices intended for small groups of patients, as the costs for the transition made it economically difficult for manufacturers to undertake conformity assessment.”. “The proposed introduction of pathways for breakthrough innovation and orphan devices is critical for more rapid access to needed, safe and effective technologies,” MedTech Europe wrote.

Instead, it has developed a supervisory-led approach, most notably through proposals by theMonetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)for AI risk management guidelines for financial institutions. Unlike the EU AI Act’s predefined risk categories, MAS is proposing a dynamic, context-sensitive approach, assessing AI risk based on impact, complexity, and the degree to which systems are embedded in critical business workflows.

Electric vehicles are General Motors’ “North Star.” Experience the smooth, quiet, near-instant power of an EV for yourself, and you’ll understand why. Every GM EV uses drive units – which consist of motor, inverter, and gearset – to turn electricity from the battery into motion. In an EV, the battery stores energy as direct current (DC), but the motor needs alternating current (AC) to generate rotation. Most GM drive units use permanent magnet propulsion, meaning the motor’s “instruments” are magnets. Electric motors use these magnetic forces to turn electrical energy into rotational force, called torque. In an EV, you don’t need a separate set of gears to make the car back up — when you shift into Reverse, the EV’s computer simply tells the drive unit to spin in the opposite direction.",35.8,0.1
