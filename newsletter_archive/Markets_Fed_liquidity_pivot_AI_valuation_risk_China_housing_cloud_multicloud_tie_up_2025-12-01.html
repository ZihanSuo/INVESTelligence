    <h1>Markets: Fed liquidity pivot, AI valuation risk, China housing, cloud multicloud tie-up</h1>

    <div>
      <p>Date: 2025-12-01 — Today’s briefing covers five developments that matter for markets and portfolios: the Fed’s end to quantitative tightening and the market’s repricing of rate cuts; valuation risks in AI-heavy mega-caps; continued weakness in China’s housing market; and a major multicloud networking tie-up from AWS and Google Cloud.</p>

<h2>Fed ends QT; markets recalibrate</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s runoff of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities ended on Dec. 1, halting a steady liquidity drain that had been compressing bank reserves and pressuring liquidity-sensitive assets. This stabilizes reserve levels and reduces a persistent headwind for bond prices. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm">Source</a>. Markets treated the move as a turning point: after the Fed signaled a less restrictive stance in October, the odds of near-term rate cuts climbed and risk assets rallied as funding-stress concerns eased (<a href="https://x.com/Cointelegraph/status/1995342128323395743">Cointelegraph</a>, <a href="https://etffocus.substack.com/p/etf-macro-strategy-update-markets">ETF Focus</a>).</p>

<h2>Market pricing: higher odds of a December cut</h2>
<p>Futures and pricing models showed a sharp jump in the probability of a December 25-bp Fed cut (into the mid-80s%), prompting equity gains, lower Treasury yields and a softer dollar. That repricing lifts assets that benefit from easier policy but makes portfolios sensitive to a data-driven reversal — if jobs or inflation surprise hot, yields could re-price higher and expose stretched positions.

<h2>AI mania: valuation risks for mega-caps</h2>
<p>AI enthusiasm has driven extreme multiples for a small set of leaders (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet). Analysts warn that a meaningful slowdown in AI capex or weaker cash flows could compress multiples materially — Goldman Sachs estimated downside to broad market valuation if AI investment slows — and commentators have flagged stretched prices and rising regulatory scrutiny. Investors should watch corporate capex guidance, cash-flow trends and regulatory developments; a pause in growth would likely mean multiple compression and wider market impact. <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ai-bubble-explained/">Source</a>, <a href="https://www.ainvest.com/news/valuation-caution-ai-giants-musk-commentary-nvidia-alphabet-cash-flow-regulatory-scrutiny-2512/">Source</a>, <a href="https://www.bitget.com/amp/news/detail/12560605089555">Source</a>.</p>

<h2>China housing: uneven prices and downside risk</h2>
<p>Private data show new-home prices ticked up modestly in November while resale (secondary) prices continued to fall, highlighting uneven demand between developer projects and the secondary market. Housing remains a central growth engine in China; weak prices weigh on household wealth, consumption and local government revenues tied to land sales. Watch resale prices, developer defaults, land-sale receipts and Beijing’s policy responses for signs the slump is contained or widening. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/">Source</a>, <a href="https://www.ubs.com/">Source</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/">Source</a>.</p>

<h2>Cloud: AWS and Google launch multicloud networking</h2>
<p>AWS and Google Cloud unveiled a jointly managed multicloud networking service that provisions private, high-bandwidth links between the two providers in minutes, reducing latency and easing large data movement across clouds. The service lowers vendor lock-in for latency-sensitive workloads (AI training/inference, streaming, fintech) and shifts multicloud from concept toward mainstream adoption. Key near-term items: pricing/region availability, enterprise pilots, and competitors’ responses. <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/12/01/amazon-and-google-launch-multicloud-service-for-faster-connectivity">Source</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/aws-and-google-cloud-collaborate-on-multicloud-networking">Source</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/preview-aws-interconnect-multicloud/">Source</a>.</p>

<p>Conclusion — implications and next steps: the Fed’s halt to QT reduces a steady liquidity drain and, combined with the market’s aggressive repricing of cuts, favors risk-on positioning but raises sensitivity to macro data. Valuation concentration in AI winners and China’s housing fragility present asymmetric downside risks; investors should prioritize liquidity, monitor earnings/capex signals and macro prints, and reassess exposure where gains are narrow or policy risk is elevated. On technology, the AWS–Google multicloud tie-up is structural: it eases data movement and reduces lock-in, which may accelerate enterprise AI deployments and shift vendor risk dynamics.</p>
